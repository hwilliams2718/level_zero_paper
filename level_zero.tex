\section{Introduction}

Given a finite quiver $Q$ without oriented cycles, there is an associated group $G$: the Kac-Moody group whose Dynkin diagram is the underlying unoriented graph of $Q$. The representation theory of $Q$ is connected to $G$ and its Lie algebra in a range of ways; for example, one has the classical result of [BGP] that if $Q$ is of ADE type, its irreducible representations are classified by the positive roots of $G$. In this paper we explore a new relationship, suggested by the results of \cite{YZ08} in finite type. Broadly speaking, we will be interested in the interplay between the following two trichotomies in the representation theories of $Q$ and $G$.

%The relationship is naturally stated in the language of cluster algebras, and takes the form on an interplay between two trichotomies in the representation theory of quivers and Kac-Moody groups: the classification of indecomposable $Q$-representations as preprojective, preinjective, or regular, and the classication of irreducible $G$-representations (say, in affine type) as positive-level, negative-level, or level zero.

Recall that the representation theory of $Q$, or any finite-dimensional algebra, is organized by the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau: \rep Q \to \rep Q$ \cite{ASS06}\sayDR{Why is this not showing up as [ASS06]?}. An indecomposable representation $M$ is projective if and only if $\tau(M) = 0$, and is injective if and only if $M$ is not of the form $\tau(N)$ for some $N$. With this in mind one says $M$ is preprojective if $\tau^k(M) = 0$ for $k\gg 0$, preinjective if it is not of the form $\tau^k(N)$ for $k\gg 0$, and regular otherwise. Preprojective and preinjective representations coincide exactly when $Q$ is of ADE type, in which case there are no regular representations. 

On the other hand, the representation theory of $G$ is largely centered around its (dual) categories of highest- and lowest-weight representations [KP, Kum]. These coincide exactly when $G$ is a simple algebraic group, in which case they include all representations of $G$ with finite-dimensional weight spaces. In general $G$ has many other such representations, which are only well-understood when $G$ is of affine type [Cha]. In this case, an irreducible representation is highest-weight, lowest-weight, or neither if its level (the character by which $Z(G) \cong \CC^\times$ acts) is positive, negative, or zero.

%While the full representation theory of $G$ is in general not well-understood, it has a well-behaved category of highest weight representations. These share many properties of finite-dimensional representations of simple Lie groups, which they specialize to when $G$ is finite-dimensional. There is a dual subcategory of lowest-weight representations. These categories coincide if and only if $G$ is finite-dimensional, in which case they encompass all representations with finite-dimensional weight spaces. Aside from this case, a complete description of all such representations exists only when $Q$ is of affine type. In this case $G$ is the central $\CC^\times$-extension of a loop group, and irreducible representations are categorized by their level: the character by which the center acts. 

We connect these two classifications by passing through the cluster algebra $\cA_Q$ \cite{FZ02}. 
This is an algebra equipped with a (partial) canonical basis whose elements are called cluster variables. 
%The relationship we study is mediated by the cluster algebra $\cA_Q$. 
From the perspective of $G$, an orientation of its Dynkin diagram is equivalent to a choice of Coxeter element $c$ in its Weyl group; the cluster algebra $\cA_Q$ (with suitable frozen variables) is the coordinate ring of the double Bruhat cell  $$G^{c,c^{-1}} := B_+ c B_+ \cap B_- c^{-1} B_- \subset G,$$
where $B_+$ and $B_-$ are the usual opposite Borel subgroups [BFZ, Wil]. 
The varieties $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ generalize the space of tridiagonal matrices with determinant equal to one, which they recover when $G=SL_n$ and $c$ is the standard Coxeter element.

From the perspective of $Q$, $\cA_Q$ is a repository for information about the submodule structure of representations of $Q$. 
After embedding $\cA_Q$ into the ring of Laurent polynomials in the initial cluster variables, the remaining cluster variables are in bijection with the rigid indecomposable representations of $Q$ [CC, CK]. 
This correspondence takes a quiver representation to a generating function of the Euler characteristics of its varieties of submodules. 
This expression is called the cluster character of the representation, and with this in mind we refer to a (non-initial)\sayDR{Even the initial cluster variables have a projective flavor in the categorification since they are identified with shifted projectives in the cluster category, but I'm not sure how much of this we want to say in the paper.}\sayHW{I think I'm happiest letting initial cluster variables be their own thing -- we should mention the cluster category at some point though, if just in passing.} cluster variable as preprojective, preinjective, or regular according to the classification of its associated representation. 
Given the description of $\cA_Q$ as the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$, we see in particular that representations of $Q$ naturally label functions on a subvariety of $G$.

%. To $c$ we associate the double Bruhat cell $$G^{c,c^{-1}} := B_+ c B_+ \cap B_- c^{-1} B_- \subset G,$$ and $\cA_Q$ can be identified with the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ (for suitable coefficients). On the other hand, a cluster algebra is equipped with a set of distinguished elements, cluster variables, which can be completed to a basis of $\cA_Q$ in various interesting ways. The (non-initial) cluster variables in $\cA_Q$ are in bijection with the rigid indecomposable representations of $Q$: $\cA_Q$ is canonically embedded in a Laurent polynomial ring, and to a representation we assign a generating function of Euler characteristics of its varieties of subrepresentations; we refer to a cluster variable as preprojective, preinjective, or regular according to its associated representation. In summary, representations of $Q$ label functions on a subvariety of $G$.

When $Q$ is of ADE type and $G$ a simple algebraic group, Yang and Zelevinsky showed these functions have an interpretation in terms of the representation theory of $G$: they are restrictions of generalized minors. 
These are functions on $G$ labeled by a representation $V$ together with an extremal one-dimensional weight space $V_\lambda$. 
Their value on $g \in G$ is the ratio of any nonzero $v \in V_\lambda$ with the projection of $gv \in V$ to $V_\lambda$. 
Our main result is that cluster variables in $\cA_Q$ are also realized as generalized minors on $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ when $Q$ is not finite type, and that moreover the resulting correspondence between quiver representations and group representations intertwines the classifications described above: 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:maintheorem}
Let $Q$ be a finite quiver without oriented cycles and $G^{c,c^{-1}} \subset G$ the associated Coxeter double Bruhat cell.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The preprojective and initial cluster variables in $\cA_Q \cong \CC[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ are restrictions of generalized minors of highest-weight representations of $G$. The preinjective cluster variables are restrictions of generalized minors of lowest-weight representations of $G$.
\item Suppose $Q$ is an acyclic orientation of an $n$-cycle, so that $G$ is the central extension of the loop group $LSL_{n}$. Then the regular cluster variables are restrictions of generalized minors of level zero representations of $G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Though above we have taken $G$ to be symmetric for simplicity, part (1) also holds in the symmetrizable case upon replacing quiver-theoretic notions with their species-theoretic counterparts. 
We emphasize that although the coordinate ring of any double Bruhat cell $G^{u,v}$ is an (upper) cluster algebra, its defining quiver is generally not an orientation of the Dynkin diagram of $G$, and one expects that most cluster variables are not restrictions of minors.

While the proof of (1) is mostly a straighforward generalization of the finite-type case (though of course, the distinction between preprojective and preinjective disappears there), the proof of (2) requires different methods. 
%The most interesting part of the Theorem is (2), in the sense that the proof of (1) is an immediate generalization of the finite-type case (though of course, the distinction between preprojective and preinjective disappears there). 
The reason (1) is true is that the preprojective and preinjective cluster variables are determined by an explicit list of relations, and these are implied by certain generalized determinental identities that hold globally on $G$. 
However, these identities depend crucially on the fact that all minors involved are semi-invariants of the standard Borel subgroups and their conjugates. 
The minors arising from level zero representations do not have this property, so the relations that determine them cannot be deduced from these identities.


Instead, we study level zero minors on the loop group $LSL_n$ %\sayDR{Shouldn't this be $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$?} 
by direct combinatorial means. The relevant representations are of the form $\big(\!\bigwedge^{\!k}\CC^n\big)[z^{\pm 1}]$, which inherits a natural basis from the standard basis of $\CC^n$. The restrictions to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ of the level zero minors appearing in (2) can be computed as a weighted sum over collections of paths through a directed network on the cylinder, as in [FM,GSV]. When $Q$ is an acyclic orientation of an $n$-cycle, its regular representations likewise have a simple combinatorial description, and one can construct by hand a bijection between their subrepresentations and collections of paths in the network.  

It would be interesting to find an interpretation of the resulting exchange relations involving level zero minors as restrictions of minor identities valid on the entire group $G$.  We believe that such identities hold more generally and should lead to a proof of the following.\sayDR{This can probably be said more cleanly.  The first statement needs to be said, do we believe the second?}

%\begin{theorem}\label{thm:maintheorem}
%Let $G$ be an affine Lie group of type $A_n^{(1)}$, let $c$ be a Coxeter element of the affine Weyl group, and $Q_c$ the associated affine quiver.  The coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is an upper cluster algebras of type $Q_c$ and all mutable cluster variables are restrictions of principal minors for representations of $G$ with finite-dimensional weight spaces.  Those that are cluster characters of preprojective, regular, or postinjective representations of $Q_c$ are minors of positive level, level zero, and negative level $G$-representations, respectively.
%\end{theorem}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:mainconjecture}
Let $Q$ be a finite quiver without oriented cycles and $G^{c,c^{-1}} \subset G$ the associated Coxeter double Bruhat cell. All regular cluster variables are generalized minors of representations that are neither highest- nor lowest-weight.
%The above theorem holds for arbitrary affine types.
\end{conjecture}

In addition to verifying the conjecture for all Coxeter elements when $G = LSL_n$, we check a finite list of other affine types, see Section \ref{sec:othertypes}. In any affine type, the regular cluster variables can be explicitly enumerated and computed. One can calculate that if they are restrictions of minors, they must come from an explicitly identifiable level zero representation. The types checked in Section \ref{sec:othertypes} are essentially the ones where these minors can be evaluated on $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ knowing only the character of this representation. In non-affine types, general weight representations of $G$ are not well-understood, and the conjecture is much more speculative.

Finally, in type $A_n^{(1)}$ the following suggestive extension of Theorem \ref{thm:maintheorem} also holds. There is a one-parameter family of quiver representations whose dimension vector is a primitive imaginary root. The cluster character of a generic element is not a cluster variable, but is an element of the generic bases, and presumably other standard bases. This element too is a level zero generalized minor; with this in mind it is natural to further ask which canonical basis elements other than cluster variables are generalized minors.

%\section{Cluster Structures on Coxeter Double Bruhat Cells}
\section{Background on clusters, quivers, and minors}

We collect here some needed material on cluster algebras and Kac-Moody groups, and lay out the notation we will use.  
We fix throughout an algebraically closed field $\kk$ of characteristic zero. 

\subsection{Cluster Algebras}

If $B$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with $m \geq n$, the principal part of $B$ is the $n \times n$ submatrix formed by the first $n$ rows. 
We say a square matrix is skew-symmetrizable if it is related to a skew-symmetric matrix through multiplication by a diagonal matrix. 
%$B$ is skew-symmetrizable if there is a diagonal matrix $D$ such that the principal part of $DB$ is skew-symmetric. \sayHW{$DB$ or $BD$?} \sayDR{It should be $BD$ if you want to multiply the entire exchange matrix}
%We say an $m \times n$ integer matrix with $m > n$, and $D$ an $m \times m$ diagonal integer matrix such that $DB$ is skew-symmetric. 
Two $m \times n$ matrices $B$ and $B'$ with skew-symmetrizable principal part are related by mutation at $k \in \{1,\dotsc,n\}$ if their entries are related by  
\[
B'_{ij} = \begin{cases}
-B_{ij} & i = k \text{ or } j = k\\
B_{ij} + \sgn(B_{ik})[B_{ik}B_{kj}]_+ & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]
Here and elsewhere we write $[a]_+$ for $\max(a,0)$ and $\sgn(a) \in \{\pm 1,0\}$ for the sign of $a$ where $\sgn(a)=0$ for $a=0$. %\sayHW{Make sure $[a]_+$ notation is properly introduced somewhere}\sayDR{We need either $\sgn(B_{ik})[B_{ik}B_{kj}]_+$ or $[B_{ik}]_+B_{kj}+B_{ik}[-B_{kj}]_+$, which is preferred?}

%We recall the definition of the cluster algebra $\cA_B$ associated to a skew-symmetrizable matrix $B$. 
To define the cluster algebra $\cA_B$ associated to an $m \times n$ matrix $B$ with skew-symmetrizable principal part we begin with an infinite $n$-ary tree  $T$. 
Label its edges by $\{1,\dotsc,n\}$ so that the edges incident to any given vertex have distinct labels. 
For a fixed root $t_0 \in T_0$, assign a matrix $B^t$ to each $t \in T_0$ so that $B^{t_0} = B$, and if $t, t' \in T_0$ are joined by an edge labeled $k$, then $B^t$ and $B^{t'}$ are related by mutation at $k$. 

Let $\cF$ denote the field of rational functions in formal variables $x_{1}\,\dotsc,x_{m}$ with coefficients in $\kk$. 
The \emph{cluster variables} $$\{ x_{i;t}: i \in \{1,\dotsc,m\}, t \in T_0\} \subset \cF$$ are defined recursively as follows. The initial cluster variables $x_{i;t_0}$ are taken to be the generators $x_i$. If $t,t' \in T_0$ are joined by an edge labeled $k$, then $x_{i;t} = x_{i;t'}$ for $i \neq k$, and $x_{k;t}$, $x_{k;t'}$ are related by the \emph{exchange relation} 
\[
x_{k;t}x_{k;t'} = \prod_{B^t_{ik}>0}x_{i;t}^{B^t_{ik}} + \prod_{B^t_{ik}<0}x_{i;t}^{-B^t_{ik}}.
\]

\begin{definition}
\emph{[FZ]} The cluster algebra $\cA_B$ is the $\kk$-subalgebra of $\cF$ generated by the set of all cluster variables.
\end{definition}

The variables $x_{n+1;t},\dotsc, x_{m;t}$ do not depend on $t$ and are referred to as frozen variables. 
We sometimes write $y_i$\sayDR{Do we need the notation $y_i$?}\sayHW{Maybe not -- revisit this during wrap-up} for $x_{n+i}$, where $i \in \{1,\dotsc, m-n\}$. 
When working with explicit formulas for cluster variables, it will also be convenient to introduce monomials $\hat{y}_j = \prod\limits_{i=1}^m x_i^{B_{ij}}$. 

We associate a quiver $Q := Q_B$ to $B$ as follows: its vertices are indexed by $\{1,\dotsc,n\}$, and there are $[-B_{ij}]_+$ arrows from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. 
Note that this prescription only records the principal part of $B$. 
We say $B$ is acyclic if $Q_B$ has no oriented cycles. 
Conversely, given a finite quiver without oriented cycles, there is a unique skew-symmetric matrix $B$ that gives rise to it in this way (though there will be many associated matrices that are only skew-symmetrizable); see Figure \ref{fig:matrices}. 
When $B$ is acyclic, $\cA_B$ is finitely generated as a $\kk$-algebra and %\sayHW{Check reference}\sayDR{It's correct.} 
coincides with the upper cluster algebra associated to $B$ [BFZ] (as such, we will not need to recall the latter notion explicitly).

\end{figure}  

Each cluster variable $x_{i;t}$ is labeled by a distinct $g$-vector $g_{i;t}$ in $\ZZ^n$. These are determined by the following relations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $g_{i;t_0}=e_i$ is the standard basis vector in $\ZZ^n$;
  \item if $t,t'\in T_0$ are joined by an edge labeled $k$, then we have\sayDR{Salvatore, I know you have a favorite way of writing this so I didn't continue.}
\end{itemize}

We will also make use of the following ``change of coefficients'' result:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:changeofcoeffs}
Let $B$ be an $m \times n$ integer matrix with skew-symmetrizable principal part, $M$ an invertible $m \times m$ matrix of the form 
\[
M = \begin{bmatrix} Id_n & 0 \\ 0 & L \end{bmatrix}
\]
for some $L\in GL_{m-n}(\ZZ)$, 
%\sayDR{Should we emphasize $L\in GL_{m-n}(\ZZ)$ so that $B'$ is guaranteed to be an integer matrix?} 
and $B' = M^{-1}B$. Then the map 
\[
x'_i \mapsto \prod_{i=1}^m x_i^{M_{ij}}
\]
extends to an isomorphism $\cA_{B'} \cong \cA_B$.
%Let $B$ and $B'$ be $(n+m)\times n$ exchange matrices and $M$ and invertible $m \times m$ matrix such that the bottom $m \times n$ part of $B$ is equal to $M$ times the bottom $m \times n$ part of $B'$.  Let $x_1,\dotsc,x_n$ and $x'_1,\dotsc,x'_n$ be the mutable initial cluster variables of $\cA(B)$ and $\cA(B')$, respectively, and $y_1,\dotsc,y_m$, $y'_1,\dotsc, y'_m$ their frozen variables.  Then the map $x'_i \mapsto x_i$, $y'_j \mapsto \prod_{i=1}^m y_i^{M_{ij}}$ extends to an isomorphism of upper cluster algebras.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Cluster Characters}

If $Q$ is a finite quiver without oriented cycles, the non-initial cluster variables in $\cA_Q$ are in bijection with the rigid indecomposable representations of $Q$ [CC, CK]. The bijection is given by associating to a representation $M$ a generating function encoding its submodule structure, referred to as its cluster character or Caldero-Chapoton function. 

The definition of the cluster character involves the coindex $\coind(M) \in \ZZ^n$. If
\[
0 \to M \to \bigoplus I_j^{a_j} \to \bigoplus I_j^{b_j} \to 0
\]
is an injective resolution of $M$, then $\coind(M)$ is the element of $\ZZ^n$ whose $j$th component is $a_j - b_j$. Below we write $x^{-\coind(M)}$ for the monomial $\prod x_j^{b_j - a_j}$. 

Given a dimension vector $e \in \NN^n$, the quiver Grassmannian $\Gr_eM$ is the variety of $e$-dimensional submodules of $M$. We write $\chi(\Gr_eM)$ for its Euler characteristic, \sayHW{Mumble something about Etale cohomology or specify representations are over $\CC$?}\sayDR{Should we also say ``with compact supports''?} and write $\hat{y}^e$ for the monomial $\prod_j \hat{y}_j^{e_j}$, where $e_j$\sayDR{At some points below (and above now) we use $e_j$ for standard basis vectors, should those be changed to something like $\varepsilon_j$?} is the $j$th component of $e \in \NN^n$.  

\begin{definition}
The cluster character of a representation $M$ of $Q$ is
\[
x_M := x^{-\coind(M)} \sum_{e \in \NN^n}\chi(\Gr_eM) \hat{y}^e \in \kk[x_1^{\pm 1},\dotsc,x_m^{\pm 1}]
\]
\end{definition}

Recall that a representation $M$ of $Q$ is rigid if $\Ext^1(M,M) = 0$. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:CCbijection} \emph{[CC, CK]} 
The assignment $M \mapsto x_M$ defines a bijection between the set of rigid indecomposable representations of $Q$ and the set of non-initial cluster variables in $\cA_Q$. 
\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{thm:CCbijection} generalizes to the case of skew-symmetrizable matrices by replacing quiver representations with species representations. We refer to [R15]\sayDR{We could also refer to Demonet and mention quivers with automorphism.} for details, though we will not make direct use of this here.

%\subsection{PROVISIONAL: Generalities and main theorem}
%Things to do here:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item
%    Introduce KM goups
%  \item
%    Say we restrict to derived subgroups (mention that this is just a trick to get rid of some irrelevant coefficients and that we could do without at the cost of heavier notation) 
%  \item
%    define generalized minors
%  \item
%    recall double bruhat decomposition
%  \item
%    Decide if, for the general and preproj/postinj sections, we assume $c=s_1\cdots s_n$ and permute the rows and columns of $A$ and $B$ accordingly. 
%    If not introduce $\prec_c$ and revisit all the statements.
%    If we do not make this assumption the explicit formulas in the next subsection (together with the various proofs in the preproj/postinj section) need to be altered significantly.
%  \item
%    prove thm: $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is upper cluster algebra with coefficients $\Delta$ (Basically cite Harold)
%  \item
%    prove prop: we can rescale coefficients to have principal. 
%    This is needed because Harold's theorem says that $\CC[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ is a cluster algebra with a different set of coefficients.
%    Use the notation $z_i$ and $z_{-i}$ for the new coefficients.
%    The choice of having the same letter and $\pm$ indices is justified by this explicit computation

%    Not having picked the letter $y$ should help to distinguish principal coefficients from doubled principal coefficients.

\subsection{Kac-Moody groups and generalized minors}

For each symmetrizable Cartan matrix $A$ there is an associated Kac-Moody group $\widehat{G}:=\widehat{G}_A$. 
It has several variants, and we consider the minimal version studied in [KP] and [Kum, Sec. 7.4]. 
This is an ind-algebraic group whose derived subgroup $G$ is generated by coroot subgroups $\varphi_i: SL_2 \into G$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Starting from $G$, the larger group $\widehat{G}$ is obtained as a semidirect product with an algebraic torus of dimension equal to the corank of $A$.
%isomorphic to  $G \rtimes (\kk^\times)^{\corank(A)}$. 

For $t \in \kk^\times$ and $1 \leq i \leq n$ we adopt the notation 
\begin{gather}
x_{i}(t):=\varphi_i\begin{pmatrix} 1 & t \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} \quad  
t^{\alpha_i^\vee}:=\varphi_i\begin{pmatrix}t & 0 \\ 0 & t^{-1}\end{pmatrix} \quad
x_{-i}(t):=\varphi_i\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ t & 1\end{pmatrix} \\
\ol{s_{i}} = \varphi_i \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad
\dol{s_{i}} = \varphi_i \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix},
\end{gather}\sayDR{Are the $\dol{s_{i}}$ needed?}\sayHW{Maybe not -- check during wrap-up}
By extension for any $w$ in the Weyl group $W$ of $\widehat{G}$ we set $\ol{w} = \ol{s_{i_1}}\cdots\ol{s_{i_k}}$, where $s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_k}$ is any reduced word for $w$. 
We write $H$ for the ($n$-dimensional) Cartan subgroup of $G$, likewise $\widehat{H} \cong H \times (\kk^\times)^{\corank(A)}$ for the Cartan subgroup of $\widehat{G}$. We also let $\kk[\widehat{G}]$ denote the (complete topological) algebra of regular functions on $\widehat{G}$.
%The Cartan subgroup $H$ of $G$ (resp. $\widehat{H}$ of $\widehat{G}$) is $n$-dimensional (resp. ($n + \corank(A)$)-dimensional). 

When $A$ is of finite type, $G \cong \widehat{G}$ is a simply-connected semisimple algebraic group. When $A$ is of (untwisted) affine type, $G$ can be identified with the universal central extension of the group $LG^\circ$ of algebraic loops (that is, regular maps from $\kk^\times$) into some simply-connected semisimple algebraic group $G^\circ$; in this case $\widehat{G}$ is obtained by adjoining a factor of $\kk^\times$ acting by loop rotations.

%We denote its ($n$-dimensional) Cartan subgroup by $H$, its standard opposite Borel subgroups by $B_\pm$, and its root and weight lattices by $Q \subset P = \Hom(H,\kk^\times)$. 
%When $A$ is of (untwisted) affine type, $G$ is the universal central extension of the group of regular maps from $\kk^\times$ to a simple algebraic group $G^\circ$. 

%The group $G$ is the derived subgroup of a larger group $\widehat{G}$, which is the semidirect product of $G$ with an algebraic torus of dimension equal to $n$ minus the rank of $A$; in the affine case this is the group that also includes a copy of $\kk^\times$ acting by loop rotations. We write $\widehat{H}$ for its Cartan subgroup (which contains $H$), $\widehat{P}$ for the extended weight lattice $\Hom(\widehat{H},\kk^\times)$, and fix once and for all a splitting $P \into \widehat{P}$ of the natural map $\widehat{P} \onto P$.

%Given a symmetrizable Cartan matrix $A$, there is an associated Kac-Moody group $G:=G_A$. 
%It has several variants, and we consider the minimal version studied in [KP]. 
%This is an ind-algebraic group generated by coroot subgroups $\varphi_i: SL_2 \into G$. 
%We denote its ($n$-dimensional) Cartan subgroup by $H$, its standard opposite Borel subgroups by $B_\pm$, and its root and weight lattices by $Q \subset P = \Hom(H,\kk^\times)$. 
%When $A$ is of (untwisted) affine type, $G$ is the universal central extension of the group of regular maps from $\kk^\times$ to a simple algebraic group $G^\circ$. 

%The group $G$ is the derived subgroup of a larger group $\widehat{G}$, which is the semidirect product of $G$ with an algebraic torus of dimension equal to $n$ minus the rank of $A$; in the affine case this is the group that also includes a copy of $\kk^\times$ acting by loop rotations. We write $\widehat{H}$ for its Cartan subgroup (which contains $H$), $\widehat{P}$ for the extended weight lattice $\Hom(\widehat{H},\kk^\times)$, and fix once and for all a splitting $P \into \widehat{P}$ of the natural map $\widehat{P} \onto P$.

Generalized minors are certain functions on $\widehat{G}$, recovering the usual notion of minors when $\widehat{G} \cong SL_n$. 
The general definition involves the representation theory of $\widehat{G}$. This discussion involves the weight lattices $\widehat{P} = \Hom(\widehat{H},\kk^\times) \onto P = \Hom(H,\kk^\times)$, and we fix once and for all a splitting $P \into \widehat{P}$ (this is equivalent to fixing an isomorphism $\widehat{G} \cong G \rtimes (\kk^\times)^{\corank(A)}$). 
By a weight representation $V$ of $\widehat{G}$ we will always mean an algebraic representation that splits as a direct sum
\[
V = \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \widehat{P}} V_\lambda
\]
of finte-dimensional weight spaces under the action of $\widehat{H}$. Note that the weight spaces of $V$ as a $G$-representation are not necessarily finite-dimensional, as the weight decomposition of the $\widehat{H}$-action is finer than that of the $H$-action. 


%We will be interested in principal generalized minors on $G$, and to define these we recall a little representation theory. Let $P$ be the weight lattice $\Hom(H,\kk^\times)$, and $Q \subset P$ the root lattice of $G$. Let $P^+ \subset P$ denote the set of dominant weights, which are nonnegative integral combinations of the fundamental weights $\omega_1,\dotsc,\omega_n$. Each $\lambda \in P^+$ labels an irreducible highest-weight representation $L(\lambda)$ of $\widehat{G}$. This is a weight representation with finite-dimensional weight spaces; the weights that appear lie in the convex hull of the (infinite) Weyl group orbit of $\lambda$ in $P$. 

Let $\widehat{P}^+=\{\lambda \in \widehat{P}: \lambda(\alpha_i^\vee)>0\} \subset \widehat{P}$ denote the cone of dominant (integral) weights.  
To each $\lambda \in \widehat{P}^+$ is an associated irreducible highest-weight representation $V(\lambda)$ of $\widehat{G}$.
Similarly, for each $\lambda \in -\widehat{P}^+$ there is an irreducible lowest-weight representation $V(\lambda)$ of $\widehat{G}$.
For any $w\in W$ and $\lambda\in\pm\widehat{P}^+$, the weight space $V(\lambda)_{w\lambda}$ is one-dimensional and thus we also write $V(w\lambda)$ for $V(\lambda)$.  
The Tits cone $X = \{w\lambda : w \in W, \lambda \in \widehat{P}^+\}$ is the set of weights which can be obtained from a dominant weight by the action of the Weyl group. 
Thus each weight $\lambda\in X \cup -X$ determines an irreducible (highest- or lowest-) weight representation $V(\lambda)$ of $\widehat{G}$ whose weight space $V(\lambda)_\lambda$ is one-dimensional.
Note that highest- and lowest-weight representations are distinct classes unless $A$ is of finite-type.

When $A$ is of (untwisted) affine type, identifying $G$ with a central extension of $LG^\circ$ fixes a splitting $P \cong P^\circ \oplus \ZZ \kappa$, %\sayDR{Should this have $\ZZ\kappa$ so that $P$ is a lattice?} 
where $P^\circ$ is the weight lattice of the underlying semisimple group $G^\circ$ and $\kk \kappa = \Hom( Z(G),\kk^\times)$.
Above this we have the splitting $\widehat{P} \cong P \oplus \ZZ \delta$, where $\delta$ is a character of the $\kk^\times$ acting by loop rotations. 
A weight $\lambda \in \widehat{P}$ is in the complement of $X \cup -X$ if and only if it lies in $P^\circ \oplus \ZZ \delta$. 
Following the above notation, for $\lambda^\circ\in P^\circ$ we have an irreducible $G^\circ$-representation $V(\lambda^\circ)$ whose highest weight is conjugate to $\lambda^\circ$ under the Weyl group of $G^\circ$. 
%For such $\lambda$, we write $V(\lambda)^\circ$ for the irreducible $G^\circ$ representation whose highest weight is conjugate to the $P^\circ$ component of $\lambda$ under the Weyl group of $G^\circ$. 
With this in hand we extend our association of an irreducible $\widehat{G}$-representation $V(\lambda)$ to all $\lambda \in \widehat{P}$: when $\lambda \in \widehat{P} \smallsetminus(X \cup -X)$ we set $V(\lambda) := V(\lambda^\circ)[z^{\pm 1}]$, \sayDR{Should we mention somewhere that all $\lambda^\circ+r\kappa$ are in the same Weyl group orbit?}\sayHW{You mean that $W$ preserves the $\ZZ\kappa$ component of a weight? I don't think it's necessary to parse the ensuing definition, and I'm already a little unhappy with the wordcount here anyway...}\sayDR{Maybe I am confused, it seems to be implicit in the definition that the $\kappa$ component of $\lambda$ is irrelevant in defining $V(\lambda)$ so by our conventions above it seems to suggest that any choice of coefficient for $\kappa$ results in the same representation, i.e. they are all in the same Weyl orbit, is this false?  Or is it a question of how we grade $z$?} the space of algebraic loops in $V(\lambda^\circ)$, where $\lambda^\circ$ is the $P^\circ$-component of $\lambda$. 
The level of an irreducible $\widehat{G}$-representation is the character by which $Z(G) = Z(\widehat{G}) \cong \kk^\times$ acts; the level of $V(\lambda)$ is positive if $\lambda \in X$, negative if $\lambda \in -X$, and zero if $\lambda \in \widehat{P} \smallsetminus(X \cup -X)$. 
%or zero if $\lambda \in X$, $\lambda \in -X$, or $\lambda \in \widehat{P} \smallsetminus (X \cup -X)$, respectively.
%the level of $V(\lambda)$ is positive, negative, or zero if $\lambda \in X$, $\lambda \in -X$, or $\lambda \in \widehat{P} \smallsetminus (X \cup -X)$, respectively.

\begin{definition}
Let $V$ be a weight representation of $\widehat{G}$ and $\lambda$ a weight for which the weight space $V_\lambda$ is one-dimensional. The principal generalized minor $\Delta_{(V,\lambda)} \in \kk[\widehat{G}]$ is the function 
\[
g \mapsto \pi_\lambda(gv_\lambda)/v_\lambda,
\]
where $\pi_\lambda:V \onto V_\lambda$ is the projection whose kernel is the direct sum of the other weight spaces, and $v_\lambda \in V_\lambda$ is any nonzero vector. When $\lambda \in X \cup -X$, or when $\widehat{G}$ is of untwisted affine type and $\lambda$ is arbitrary, we simply write $\Delta_\lambda$ for $\Delta_{(V(\lambda),\lambda)}$. When $\lambda \in X \cup -X$ and $\lambda' = w \lambda$, the generalized minor $\Delta^{\lambda}_{\lambda'}$ is the function $g \mapsto \Delta_\lambda(g\ol{w})$. \sayHW{Check the exact formula} 
%Given $\lambda \in X \cup -X$, the principal generalized minor $\Delta_\lambda \in \kk[G]$ is the function
%\[
%g \mapsto \pi_\lambda(gv_\lambda)/v_\lambda \in \kk.
%\]
%That is, its value at $g$ is a diagonal matrix coefficient in a matrix by which $g$ acts on $L(\lambda)$.
%Let $\lambda \in P^+$ be a dominant weight and $\lambda_1 = w_1\lambda$, $\lambda_2 = w_2 \lambda \in X$ be any two conjugates under the Weyl group. The 
\end{definition}

In other words, if we use a weight basis of $V$ to write the action of $g$ as a matrix, $\Delta_{(V,\lambda)}(g)$ is the diagonal entry corresponding to $V_\lambda$. Similarly, $\Delta^{\lambda}_{\lambda'}(g)$ is the matrix entry whose row corresponds to $V_{\lambda'}$ and whose column corresponds to $V_{\lambda}$ (up to an overall scalar fixed by the representative $\ol{w} \in \widehat{G}$ of $w$).

\begin{remark}
When $\widehat{G}$ is of affine type, the representations $V(\lambda)$ with $\lambda \in \widehat{P}\smallsetminus(X \cup - X)$ are not the only irreducible level zero weight representations. The set of all such representations is parametrized by pairs $(\{\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_m\},\{a_1,\dotsc,a_m\})$ of a tuple of dominant weights of $G^\circ$ and a tuple of elements of $\kk^\times$ [Cha]. As a vector space the associated representation is the space of Laurent polynomials valued in the tensor product of the $V(\lambda_i^\circ)$, and the scalars $a_i$ rescale the action of $G^\circ$-valued loops on each factor [CP].
\end{remark}

A crucial feature of generalized minors is the following generalized determinantal identity:

\begin{proposition}[FZ, Wil13]
  \label{prop:fundid}
  Suppose $u,v \in W$ and $1 \leq i \leq n$ are such that $\ell(u)<\ell(us_i)$ and $\ell(v)<\ell(vs_i)$. 
  Then 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundid}
    \Delta_{u\omega_i}^{v\omega_i} \Delta_{us_i\omega_i}^{vs_i\omega_i} 
    =
    \prod_{\stackrel{1\leq j \leq n}{j\neq i}}\left(\Delta_{u\omega_j}^{v\omega_j}\right)^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \Delta_{us_i\omega_i}^{v\omega_i} \Delta_{u\omega_i}^{vs_i\omega_i}
  \end{equation}
is satisfied on $G$.
\end{proposition}

We will directly use the above identity, but note that it restricts from a similar one on $\widehat{G}$ that also involves the characters of $\widehat{G}/G$.

\subsection{Acyclic cluster algebras from double Bruhat cells}

The data of an acyclic skew-symmetrizable matrix $B$ is equivalent to the data of a symmetrizable Cartan matrix $A$ together with a Coxeter element $c$ of its Weyl group. The Cartan matrix is obtained from $B$ by making all its entries negative without changing their absolute values, then setting each diagonal entry equal to two; see Figure \ref{fig:matrices}. The Coxeter element is $c = s_{\sigma_1} \cdots s_{\sigma_n}$, where $\sigma \in S_n$ is any permutation for which $\sigma_i > \sigma_j$ whenever there is an arrow from $i$ to $j$ in $Q_B$. Conversely, any Coxeter element $c$ arises in this way from a unique skew-symmetrizable matrix, which we write as $B_c$. 

The cluster algebra $\cA_B$ has the following geometric realization in terms of the Kac-Moody group associated to $A$. We recall the double Bruhat decomposition
\[
G = \bigsqcup_{u,v \in W} G^{u,v},\quad G^{u,v} : = B_+ u B_+ \cap B_- v B_-
\]
of $G$, where $B_{\pm}$ are the standard opposite Borel subgroups of $G$. Each $G^{u,v}$ is a smooth affine variety of dimension $n + \ell(u) + \ell(v)$, where $\ell(u)$, $\ell(v)$ are the lengths of $u$ and $v$ [FZ, Wil]. \saySS{This already requires that we are working with the derived subgroup}\sayHW{I think the remark below now adequately addresses this -- delete comments if you agree}
The coordinate ring of $G^{u,v}$ is an upper cluster algebra, and a finite subset of its clusters are in correspondence with shuffles of reduced words for $u$ and $v$ [BFZ, Wil]. 

%Let $G := G_B$ be the Kac-Moody group associated to this root system. The cluster algebra has the following geometric realization in terms of $G$:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:coordring}\say[Group]{We need to think carefully about the change of coefficents, keeping in mind [Yang,Zelevinsky: p. 21] at the end of Sec. 4 and [Berenstein,Rupel: Lemma 6.8].}
The coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is isomorphic to the cluster algebra associated to the $3n \times n$ matrix whose principal part is $B_c$ and whose bottom $n \times n$ blocks are identity matrices. 
The isomorphism takes the initial cluster variables to restrictions of monomials in generalized minors; for $1 \leq j \leq n$ we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:initialcluster}
x_j \mapsto \Delta_{\omega_j},\quad x_{j+n} \mapsto \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i})^{a_{ij}},\quad x_{j+2n} = \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i})^{a_{ij}}.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $B'$ be the $3n \times n$ matrix with principal part $B_c$ and with $B'_{i+n,j} = B'_{i+2n,j} = [i = j] + a_{ij}[i < j]$ for $i,j \in [1,n]$.  Then the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is the upper cluster algebra with exchange matrix $B'$, initial cluster variables $\Delta_{\omega_i}$, and frozen variables $\Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i}$, $\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i}$ [BFZ,Wil]. Since $B_c$ is acylic, the upper cluster algebra and cluster algebra coincide [BFZ]. The proposition then follows from an application of \Cref{prop:changeofcoeffs}.
\end{proof}

We often write $z_i$ for $x_{i+n}$ and $z_{-i}$ for $x_{i+2n}$, and say that $\kk[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ is a cluster algebra with ``doubled principal coefficients.''

\begin{remark}
Each $G^{u,v}$ is the intersection of $G \subset \widehat{G}$ with the double Bruhat cell $\widehat{G}^{u,v}$ of $\widehat{G}$. The coordianate ring of the latter is also an upper cluster algebra whose initial exchange matrix has the same principal part but $\corank(A)$ additional frozen variables -- $G^{u,v}$ is the locus where these are equal to one. In the other direction one could consider the $2n$-dimensional subvariety $L^{c,c^{-1}} \subset G^{c,c^{-1}}$ where $z_1,\dotsc,z_n$ are equal to one -- this is the reduced double Bruhat cell considered in \cite{YZ08}.
\end{remark}

In computing various relations in $\kk[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ we will make extensive use of the fact that a generic element $g$ of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ can be factored as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:generic_element}
  g=x_{-1}(t_{-1}) \cdots x_{-n}(t_{-n}) h x_n(t_n) \cdots x_1(t_1)
\end{equation}
for some $h \in H$ and $t_i \in \kk^\times$ [FZ,Wil]. 
For example, with respect to such a factorization it is clear that for any dominant weight $\lambda \in \widehat{P}^+$, we have $\Delta_\lambda(g) = h^\lambda$. Some similar computations are collected in Lemma \ref{lemma:coefficients_values}. 
%Here we write 
%\begin{equation}
%  x_{-i}(t):=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ t & 1\end{array}\right)
%  \quad
%  \quad
%  x_i(t):=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & t \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)
%\end{equation}
%and for $t \in \kk^\times$
%\begin{equation}
%  t^{\alpha_i^\vee}:=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}t & 0 \\ 0 & t^{-1}\end{array}\right)
%\end{equation}

%\saySS{This should cover all the minors we care about; please correct me if I am mistaken}
%Given $u,v\in W$ and $\lambda$ a weight, we denote by $\Delta_{u\lambda}^{v\lambda}$ the matrix coefficient 
%\begin{equation}
%  \Delta_{u\lambda}^{v\lambda}(g) 
%  := 
%  \left(\left[ \overline{u}^{-1}g\overline{v} \right]_0\right)^\lambda
%\end{equation}
%When $u=v$ above, we will write $\Delta_{u\lambda}$ instead of $\Delta_{u\lambda}^{u\lambda}$.

%\subsection{Explicit computations}
%\saySS{This subsection is written assuming $c=s_1\cdots s_n$}
%\saySS{the rationale of this subsection is to introduce the notation for the generic element of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ that we use in both the preproj/postinj and the regular sections. With the excuse, having showed that we have a cluster algebra by pinpointing generalized minors it sounds like a good idea to say what are they.}
%For later use we record here the values that both the initial cluster variables and the coefficients of $\CC[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ assume on the generic element of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$.
%In most cases to obtain these formulas it suffices to perform a straightforward computation in the relevant representation (either $L_{\omega_i}$ or $L_{-\omega_i}$) so we will omit proofs.

%For $i\in[1,n]$ let $\varphi_i:SL_2\rightarrow G$ denote the canonical embedding corresponding to the simple root $\alpha_i$. 
%For $t\in\CC$ 
%Here we write 
%\begin{equation}
%  x_{-i}(t):=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ t & 1\end{array}\right)
%  \quad
%  \quad
%  x_i(t):=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & t \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)
%\end{equation}
%and for $t \in \kk^\times$
%\begin{equation}
%  t^{\alpha_i^\vee}:=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}t & 0 \\ 0 & t^{-1}\end{array}\right)
%\end{equation}
%so that the generic element of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:generic_element}
%  g=x_{-1}(t_{-1}) \cdots x_{-n}(t_{-n}) h x_n(t_n) \cdots x_1(t_1)
%\end{equation}
%with $h\in H$ and $t_{\pm i} \in \CC$ (cf. \cite[Proposition 3.2]{Wil13} were we prefer to place the torus part in central position using the classical commutation relations \cite[(2.5)]{FZ99}).

%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{lemma:initial_cluster_variables}
%  On the generic element $g$ of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ expressed as in \Cref{eq:generic_element} the initial cluster variables of $\CC[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ assume the following values:
%  \begin{equation}
%    \Delta_{\omega_i}(g) = h^{\omega_i}
%  \end{equation}

%Keeping in mind that for any $k\geq0$ the word $c^k$ is reduced (cf. \cite{Spe09}), we also get the following.

%  On the generic element $g$ of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ expressed as in \Cref{eq:generic_element} the following can be computed explicitly for any $k\geq 0$:

\section{Preprojective and preinjective cluster variables as minors}
%\subsection{The acyclic belt in non-finite types}
In this section we prove that when $B$ is any acyclic skew-symmetrizable matrix, the identification $\cA_B \cong \kk[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ realizes preprojective and postinjective cluster variables as restrictions of highest- and lowest-weight minors, respectively. We begin by computing the $\bfg$-vectors of these cluster variables; identifying the lattice of $\bfg$-vectors with the weight lattice of $G$, these are the weights of the corresponding minors, and they all lie in the orbit of the fundamental weights (and their negatives) under the action of the Coxeter element $c$. We then compute a list of exchange relations which determine all such cluster variables in terms of initial ones. The identification with minors then follows by identifying these relations with restrictions of certain generalized determinantal identities to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$.

\subsection{Exchange relations and $\bfg$-vectors}

Fix a skew-symmetrizable matrix $B$, and let $A$ and $c$ be the associated Cartan matrix and Coxeter element.

\begin{theorem}
Identify the $\bfg$-vector lattice of $\cA_B$ with the weight lattice of $A$ by taking the initial $\bfg$-vector $g_i$ to the fundamental weight $\omega_i$. Under this identification the $\bfg$-vectors of the preprojective cluster variables are in correspondence with the weights $\{c^k\omega_i : k > 0, 1 \leq i \leq n\}$, and the $\bfg$-vectors of the preinjective cluster variables are in correspondence with the weights $\{-c^k\omega_i : k \leq 0, 1 \leq i \leq n\}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
************************** \sayHW{Everything between asterisks to be reformatted into unified proof of the theorem}

In this section we present straightforward generalizations of some results from \cite[Sections 8-10]{FZ07} to the acyclic case.

Let $A$ be any irreducible Cartan matrix not of finite type and let $c=s_1\cdots s_n$ be a Coxeter element in the Weyl group of $A$.
The case when $A$ is of finite type is already covered in \cite{YZ08} and we will omit it here in order to simplify our notation.
\saySS{We can cover it if we use $w_0$ in place of $c^\infty$ to cover finite type. It is not clear to me that it is worth doing even though it will make life more uniform. Maybe we should add a comment here.}
In view of these assumptions any prefix of the word $c^\infty$ is reduced (cf. \cite{Spe09}).
Let $B_c$ be the skew-symmetrizable matrix associated to the pair $A,c$. 
\saySS{We should define $B_c$ somewhere in the introduction}
We will concern ourself with a specific sequence of seeds (the \emph{acyclic belt}) in the principal coefficients cluster algebra $\cAb(B_c)$.

More specifically, let $t_0$ be the node of the exchange graph containing the initial seed and $t_m$ the nodes given by the sequence
\begin{equation}
  \cdots
  \dashname{n}
  t_{-n}
  \dashname{1}
  \cdots
  \dashname{n-1}
  t_{-1}
  \dashname{n}
  t_0
  \dashname{1}
  t_1
  \dashname{2}
  \cdots
  \dashname{n}
  t_n
  \dashname{1}
  \cdots
\end{equation}
\saySS{We should probably comment on the fact that all these nodes of the exchange graph are distinct. It follows from the propositions we are about to prove but one might wonder whether the argument is circular here.}
\sayDR{I think the proposition below establishes this fact, I did not see any point where you assumed they were distinct in the proof.}
Following \cite{FZ02}, we denote by $\mod{m}$ the element of $[1,n]$ congruent to $m$ modulo $n$.
The edge immediately to the left of $t_m$ is then labeled by $\mod{m}$.
Observe that the nodes we are considering lie along a \emph{sink/source adapted sequence}. 
In particular, the entries of the exchange matrix $B_m$ at $t_m$ equal, in absolute value, the entries of $B_0$. 
Moreover the $\mod{m}$-th row of $B_m$ contains only non-positive entries and the $\mod{m+1}$-st row only non-negative entries.

We will interpret $\bfc$-vectors as coordinate vectors in the basis of simple roots for the root system of $A$ so that the $i$-th initial $\bfc$-vector is $\alpha_i$.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:c-vectors}
  Let $\gamma_{m,i}$ be the $i$-th $\bfc$-vector of $\cAb(B_c)$ in the seed at $t_m$. 
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    \gamma_{m,i}
    =
    \begin{cases}
      c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \alpha_i & \text{if $m>0$}\\
      \alpha_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and  $i\leq n+m$} \\
      -\alpha_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and $i>n+m$} \\
      -c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_i & \text{if $m <-n$}\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  Where, as usual, $\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor$ is the biggest integer smaller or equal to $x$ while $\left\lceil x \right\rceil$ is the smallest integer greater or equal to $x$.
  Moreover, whenever $m > 0 $ or $m < -n$, the vector $\gamma_{m,\mod{m}}$ is negative and the vector $\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}$ is positive.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
  If $m>0$ then $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}$ is the prefix of $c^\infty$ of length $m$.
  \saySS{Reminder: for $m>0$ we write $m=\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor n + \mod{m}$.}
  Similarly, if $m<-n$, $c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}}$ is the prefix of $c^{-\infty}$ of length $-m-n$.
  \saySS{Reminder: for $m<-n$ we write $-m-n =-\left(\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil+1\right)n+\mod{n-\mod{m}}$}
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  \saySS{I should remember to thank Anna and Pavel for hints on reflection groups}
  Let's begin by settling the claim about signs. 
  When $m>0$ the root $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \alpha_{\mod{m+1}}$ is positive: being a prefix of $c^\infty$, the word  $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} s_{\mod{m+1}}$ is reduced (cf. \cite{Spe09}) and we can apply \cite[VI \S 1.6 Corollary 2 to Proposition 17]{Bou02}.
  By the same principle the root $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \alpha_{\mod{m}} = -c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m-1}} \alpha_{\mod{m}}$ is negative because the word $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}$ is reduced.
  Similarly, when $m<-n$ the root $-c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_{\mod{m+1}}$ is positive and the root $-c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_{\mod{m}}$ is negative.
  
  For the main claim there are three cases to consider.

  \noindent{\bf Case $-n \leq m \leq 0$.}
  We proceed by induction on $m$.
  For $m=0$ there is nothing to check.
  By construction, while the sign of $\gamma_{m,\mod{m}}$ is positive, the sign of the $\mod{m}$-th row of $B_m$ is negative. 
  The $\bfc$-vectors at $t_{m-1}$ are therefore given by:
  \begin{equation*}
    \gamma_{m-1,i}
    =
    \begin{cases}
      \gamma_{m,i} & \text{if $i\neq \mod{m}$}\\
      -\gamma_{m,\mod{m}} & \text{if $i = \mod{m}$}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  as desired.

  \noindent{\bf Case $m > 0$.}
  We again argue by induction on $m$ the base case still being $m=0$. 
  Since the sign of $\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}$ and the sign of the $\mod{m+1}$-st row of $B_m$ are both positive, in view of \cite[Proposition 1.3]{NZ12}, the $\bfc$-vectors at $t_{m+1}$ are given by
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma_{m+1,i} 
    &= 
    \gamma_{m,i} - a_{\mod{m+1},i} \gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}\\
    &=
    \gamma_{m,i} - \frac{2(\alpha_{\mod{m+1}},\alpha_i)}{(\alpha_{\mod{m+1}},\alpha_{\mod{m+1}})} \gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}\\
    &=
    \gamma_{m,i} - \frac{2(\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}},\gamma_{m,i})}{(\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}},\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}})} \gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}\\
    &=
    s_{\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}}\big(\gamma_{m,i}\big)
  \end{align*}
  where the second to last equality holds because the pairing $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is invariant under the action of the Weyl group.  
  Using the inductive hypotheses we can then conclude
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma_{m+1,i} 
    &=
    s_{\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}}\big(\gamma_{m,i}\big)\\
    &=
    \big(c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}\big)s_{\mod{m+1}}\big(s_{\mod{m}}\cdots s_1 c^{-\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}\big)\big(c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}\alpha_i\big)\\
    &= 
    c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_i.
  \end{align*}

  \noindent{\bf Case $m < -n$.}
  The argument is the same as the one used in the case $m>0$ with $m=-n$ as base for the induction. 
  The only minor change is that this time we leverage the fact that both the sign of $\gamma_{m,\mod{m}}$ and the sign of the $\mod{m}$-th row of $B_m$ are negative.
\end{proof}

In analogy to what we did for $\bfc$-vectors, we will interpret $\bfg$-vectors as coordinate vectors in the basis of fundamental weights for the root system of $A$ so that the $i$-th initial $\bfg$-vector is $\omega_i$.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:g-vectors}
  Let $\lambda_{m,i}$ be the $\bfg$-vector of the $i$-th cluster variable of $\cAb(B_c)$ in the seed at $t_m$. 
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    \lambda_{m,i}
    =
    \begin{cases}
      c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \omega_i & \text{if $m>0$}\\
      \omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and  $i\leq n+m$} \\
      -\omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and $i>n+m$} \\
      -c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \omega_i & \text{if $m <-n$}\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  In view of \Cref{prop:c-vectors} the $\bfc$-vectors of $\cAb(-B_c^T)$ at the seed $t_m$ are the coroots $\gamma_{m,i}^\vee$.
  The result follows then immediately from \cite[Theorem 1.2]{NZ12}: fundamental weights are the dual basis of the coroot basis and the pairing is invariant under the action of the Weyl group.
\end{proof}

In view of how simple reflections act on fundamental weights the expressions of the $\bfg$-vectors $\lambda_{m,i}$ can be expressed using only powers of $c$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{m,i}
  =
  \begin{cases}
    c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor} \omega_i & \text{if $m>0$ and $i > \mod{m}$}\\
    c^{1+ \left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor} \omega_i & \text{if $m>0$ and $i \leq \mod{m}$}\\
    \omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and  $i\leq n+m$} \\
    -\omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and $i>n+m$} \\
    -c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil} \omega_i & \text{if $m <-n$ and $i < \mod{m+1}$}\\
    -c^{\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil} \omega_i & \text{if $m <-n$ and $i \geq \mod{m+1}$}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
  \saySS{Note to self, check that the formulas are correct before publishing}
In particular, in the acyclic belt of $\cAb(B_c)$, there is one cluster variable $x_{c^k\omega_i}$ with  $\bfg$-vector $c^k\omega_i$ for any $k\geq 0$, and one cluster variable $x_{-c^{-k}\omega_i}$ with $\bfg$-vector $-c^{-k}\omega_i$ again for any $k\geq 0$.
Taking inspiration from quiver representation theory we will refer to the former as \emph{preprojective} cluster variables and to the latter as \emph{postinjective} cluster variables.
\saySS{I am not entirely happy with this definition: if I am not mistaken modules corresponding to initial cluster variables are neither preprojective not postinjective. Here we force them in the preprojective field to make it easier to state exchange relations later on. Would it make sense to drop the notation entirely? Do we need it anywhere?}
\sayDR{It is really only necessary if we wish to emphasize the similarity of trichotomies: (preprojective, regular, postinjecive) and (positive level, level zero, negative level).  As you correctly pointed out the initial cluster is a bit of an anomaly from the ``classical'' representation theory perspective, but the initial cluster variables do correspond to shifted projectives in the cluster category so the terminology might still be considered acceptable.}

**************************
\end{proof}

With the preceding Theorem in hand, we write $x_{c^k\omega_i}$ for the preprojective cluster variable with the indicated $\bfg$-vector, likewise $x_{-c^k\omega_i}$ for preinjective cluster variables and $x_{\omega_i}$ for initial cluster variables. Our computation of $\bfc$-vectors leads to the following set of relations for these cluster variables. Recall from Proposition \ref{prop:coordring} that the group-theoretic realization of the cluster algebra associated to $B$ naturally comes with doubled principal coefficients; that is, the initial exchange matrix is $3n \times n$ with principal part equal to $B$ and bottom $n \times n$ blocks both equal to the identity matrix. Thus we state the relations with these coefficients, writing the frozen variables as $z_i = x_{i+n}$ and $z_{-i} = x_{i+2n}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:exchangerelations}
%The preprojective and preinjective cluster variables are determined by the following relations:
The preprojective and preinjective cluster variables with doubled principal coefficients are determined by the following relations:
  %The cluster variables in the acyclic belt of $\cAb(B_c)$ satisfy the following exchange relations $(k\geq 0)$:

  \end{align}
\end{theorem}
\saySS{We may want to substitute $s_1\dots s_{i-1}\alpha_i = \beta_i^+$ and $s_n\dots s_{i+1}\alpha_i = \beta_i^-$ to make things slightly clearer in the formulas (I am worried people might have issues in decoding the cases $i=1$ in the first and $i=n$ in the second.}
\begin{proof}
  Recall that $\beta_i^+=s_1\cdots s_{i-1}\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i^-=s_n\cdots s_{i+1}\alpha_i$. 
  The relations are an obvious consequence of \Cref{prop:c-vectors,prop:g-vectors} once we recall that mutations happen along a source/sink adapted sequence so that, at $t_m$, the $\mod{m}$-th colum of $B_m$ contains only non-negative entries and the $\mod{m+1}$-th column only non-positive entries. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Highest- and lowest-weight minors}

Before proving the main result of the section, Theorem \ref{thm:mainirregular}, we collect some lemmas concerning restrictions of minors to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$. All of the arguments involved are straightforward generalizations of those in \cite{YZ08} to the infinite-type case. 

The first lemma computes the evaluations of various minors of interest in terms of the factorization of a generic element of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ into one-parameter subgroups. We recall that, for any root $\beta \in Q$, we let $[\beta:\alpha_i]$ denote the $i^{th}$ coefficient in the expansion
\[
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^n [\beta:\alpha_i]\alpha_i.
\]
The roots to which we apply this notation are $\beta_i^+=s_1\cdots s_{i-1}\alpha_i$, $\beta_i^-=s_n\cdots s_{i+1}\alpha_i$, and their conjugates. We also recall that the initial cluster variables in $\kk[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ are 
\[
x_j = \Delta_{\omega_j},\quad z_j = \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i})^{a_{ij}},\quad z_{-j} = \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i})^{a_{ij}},
\]
for $1 \leq j \leq n$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:coefficients_values}
If $g \in G^{c,c^{-1}}$ factors as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:generic_factorization}
g = x_{-1}(t_{-1}) \cdots x_{-n}(t_{-n}) h x_n(t_n) \cdots x_1(t_1)
\end{equation}
for $h \in H$ and $t_i \in \kk^\times$, then  
\begin{gather}
    \Delta^{c^{k+1}\omega_j}_{c^k\omega_j}(g) = h^{c^k\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{-i}^{[c^k\beta_j^+:\alpha_i]},\quad 
    \Delta^{c^k\omega_j}_{c^{k+1}\omega_j}(g) = h^{c^k\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[c^k\beta_j^+:\alpha_i]},\label{eq:positive_cminor_values}\\
    \Delta^{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}_{-c^{-k}\omega_j}(g) = h^{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[c^{-k}\beta_j^-:\alpha_i]}, \quad
    \Delta^{-c^{-k}\omega_j}_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}(g) = h^{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{-i}^{[c^{-k}\beta_j^-:\alpha_i]},\label{eq:negative_cminor_values}\\
    z_i(g)
    =
    t_i
    h^{\omega_i}\prod_{ j <i}h^{a_{ j  i}\omega_ j },\quad 
    z_{-i}(g)
    =
    t_{-i}
    h^{\omega_i}\prod_{ j <i}h^{a_{ j  i}\omega_ j }.\label{eq:frozen_values}
\end{gather}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The first four identities follow easily from considering root strings in $V(\omega_i)$ as in \cite[Proof of eq. 3.20]{YZ08}, and we omit an explicit discussion. For example, if $v_{\omega_j}$ is a highest-weight vector of $V(\omega_j)$, then $\Delta^{c\omega_j}_{\omega_j}(g)$ measures the component of $gv_{\omega_j}$ in the weight space $V(\omega_j)_{c \omega_j}$; sequentially considering how each one-parameter subgroup in the factorization can affect this component leads to the given formula. \saySS{We may want to give a proof of this (Cf. \cite[Proof of eq. 3.20]{YZ08}) but we are already writing a lot of computations enough to disgust even the more coscentious reader.}\sayHW{This is a bit better than nothing for now -- we can add more later if we have time}

We derive the first identity of Equation \ref{eq:frozen_values}, the second being similar.
%  Recall the definition of $z_i$
%  \saySS{Add the relevant reference once it is in place}
%  \[
%    z_i 
%    =
%    \Delta_{c\omega_i}^{\omega_i}
%    \prod_{ j <i}\big(\Delta_{c\omega_ j }^{\omega_ j }\big)^{a_{ j  i}}
%  \]
%  and substitute the values computed in \Cref{lemma:coefficient_computations} to get
Plugging Equation \ref{eq:positive_cminor_values} into the definition of $z_i(g)$ we obtain 
  \[
    z_i(g)
    =
    \left(h^{\omega_i}\prod_{\ell =1}^n t_{\ell}^{[\beta_i^+:\alpha_\ell]}\right)
    \prod_{j<i}\left(h^{\omega_j}\prod_{\ell=1}^n t_{\ell}^{[\beta_j^+:\alpha_\ell]}\right)^{a_{ji}}.
  \]
  To establish the desired identiy we need to verify that
  \saySS{This should be changed to Harold's boolean notation}
\sayHW{Let's see if there are other places where it would be useful -- if there aren't many it may be clearer to stick to the cases notation}
  \[
    [\beta_i^+:\alpha_\ell]+\sum_{j<i}a_{ji}[\beta_j^+:\alpha_\ell]
    =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{ if $i=\ell$}\\
      0 & \text{ otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
  \]

For $g \in G^{c,c^{-1}}$, $k \geq 0$, and $1 \leq i \leq n$ we have
%  Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ the following two identities holds:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_{c^{k+1} \omega_i}^{c^k \omega_i}(g)
    =
    \prod_{j=1}^nz_j(g)^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]},\quad

    =
    \prod_{j=1}^nz_{-j}(g)^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]}
\end{equation}

%  \begin{eqnarray} 
%    \Delta_{c^k \omega_i}^{c^{k+1} \omega_i}
%    &=&
%    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
%      \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j}
%      \prod_{\ell<j}\big(
%        \Delta^{c \omega_\ell}_{\omega_\ell} 
%      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
%    \right)^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]}
%    \\
%    \Delta_{c^{k+1} \omega_i}^{c^k \omega_i}
%    &=&
%    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
%      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} 
%      \prod_{\ell<j}\big(
%        \Delta^{\omega_\ell}_{c \omega_\ell}
%      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
%    \right)^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]}
%  \end{eqnarray}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We concentrate on the first identity, the latter being obtained in a similar way. It suffices to consider the case where $g$ factors as in Equation \ref{eq:generic_factorization}, since such elements are generic in $G^{c,c^{-1}}$.  
  In the parameters of the factorization, Lemma \ref{lemma:coefficients_values} lets us rewrite the desired identity as
\[
h^{c^k\omega_i}\prod_{j=1}^n t_{j}^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]} = \prod_{j=1}^n\Big( 
    t_j
    h^{\omega_j}\prod_{ \ell <j}h^{a_{\ell j}\omega_ \ell }\Big)^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]}.
\]
Establishing this is in turn equivalent to showing that
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:coxeter_identity_omega}
    c^k\omega_i 
    =
    \sum_{j=1}^n
    [c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]
    \Big(
    \omega_j+
    \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
    \Big).
  \end{equation}
%We claim that both sides are equal to $\sum_{j=1}^n [c^k\beta_i^+:\beta_j^+] \omega_j$. 

%On one hand, since $(1-c)(\omega_i) = \beta_i^+$ and the $\beta_i^+$ are linearly independent (they are obtained from the $\alpha_i$ by a unitriangular transformation), $1-c$ is an isomorphism from the $n$-dimensional subspace of $\widehat{P}_\RR$ spanned by the $\omega_i$ to that spanned by the $\beta_i^+$. Since moreover this isomorphism commutes with $c^{k}$, the fact that $c^k\omega_i = \sum_{j=1}^n [c^k\beta_i^+:\beta_j^+] \omega_j$ follows from the tautology $c^k\beta_i^+ = \sum_{j=1}^n [c^k\beta_i^+:\beta_j^+] \beta_j^+.$

On the other hand, from Equation \ref{eq:alpha_to_beta} it follows that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:coxeter_identity_beta}
c^k\beta_i^+ = \sum_{j=1}^n [c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j] \alpha_j
= \sum_{j=1}^n [c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j] \Big(\beta_j^+ + \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\beta_\ell^+\Big).
\end{equation}
Since $(1-c)(\omega_i) = \beta_i^+$ and the $\beta_i^+$ are linearly independent (they are obtained from the $\alpha_i$ by a unitriangular transformation), the endomorphism $1-c$ of $\widehat{P}_\RR$ restricts to an isomorphism from the subspace spanned by the $\omega_i$ to that spanned by the $\beta_i^+$. Since this isomorphism moreover commutes with the action of $c^{k}$, applying its inverse to Equation \ref{eq:coxeter_identity_beta} yields Equation \ref{eq:coxeter_identity_omega}.

%  Recalling from the proof of \Cref{lemma:coefficients_values} shat
%  \[
%    \alpha_j 
%    =
%    \beta_j^+
%    +
%    \sum_{\ell < j}
%    a_{\ell j}\beta_\ell^+
%  \]
%  to show that the two expressions are equal it remains to see that
%  \[
%    c^k\omega_i 
%    =
%    \sum_{j=1}^n
%    [c^k\beta_i^+:\beta_j^+]
%    \omega_j

%    \Big(
%    \omega_j+
%    \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
%    \Big).
%  \]
%  The first equality holds because the $\beta_i^+$ are linearly independent (they are obtained from the $\alpha_i$ by a unitriangular transformation) so that $1-c$ is an isomorphism from the subspace spanned by the $\omega_i$ to that spanned by the $\beta_i^+$, commuting with $c^{m-1}$.
%  The second equality is nothing but the change of coordinates in between the $\alpha_i$ and the $\beta_i^+$.

\begin{lemma}
  Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ the following two identities hold:
  \label{lemma:coefficients_identities}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta_{c\omega_j}^{\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell<j}\big(\Delta_{c\omega_\ell}^{\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    &=&
    \Delta_{-\omega_j}^{-c^{-1}\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell>j}\big(\Delta_{-\omega_\ell}^{-c^{-1}\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}\\
    \Delta_{\omega_j}^{c\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell<j}\big(\Delta_{\omega_\ell}^{c\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    &=&
    \Delta_{-c^{-1}\omega_j}^{-\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell>j}\big(\Delta_{-c^{-1}\omega_\ell}^{-\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We will show only the first one the other being obtained in a similar fashon.
  \Cref{lemma:coefficients_values} says that the left hand side equals
  \[
    t_j
    h^{\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell<j}h^{a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell}.
  \]
  A similar computation, this time using the fact that 
  \[
    \beta_j^-+\sum_{\ell>j}a_{\ell j}\beta_\ell^-
    =
    \alpha_j,
  \]
  expresses the right hand side as
  \[
    t_j
    h^{-c^{-1}\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell>j}h^{-a_{\ell j}c^{-1}\omega_\ell}
  \]
  and the two sides are equal if
  \begin{equation}
    \omega_j + \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
    =
    -c^{-1}\left(\omega_j + \sum_{\ell>j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell\right).
  \end{equation}
  
  Mupliplying both sides by $s_{j+1}\cdots s_n$ we want to show that
  \[
    s_{j+1}\cdots s_n\left(\omega_j + \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell\right)=
    -s_js_{j-1}\cdots s_1\left(\omega_j + \sum_{\ell>j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell\right).
  \]
  Since $s_i\omega_j=\omega_j$ for $i\neq j$, this is equivalent to
  \[
    \omega_j + \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
    =
    -s_j\omega_j-\sum_{\ell>j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
  \]
  i.e. 
  \begin{equation}
    s_j\omega_j
    =
    -\omega_j-\sum_{\ell\neq j}a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
  \end{equation}
  which is the definition of $s_j\omega_j$.

%    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{-\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}(g)
%    +
%    1.
%  \]
%  Equivalently, applying $\iota$, we need to show that

%    & = &
%    t_i

%    \prod_{j>i}\Big(h^{\omega_j}\Delta_{\omega_j}(g^\iota)\Big)^{-a_{ji}}
%    +
%    1
%  \end{eqnarray*}

%  To compute $\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)$ we need to straighten up the expression of $g^\iota$ using the commutations relations (Cf. \cite[Proposition 7.2]{BZ01})
%  \begin{equation}
%    x_i(t_i)x_{-j}(t_{-j}) 
%    =
%    x_{-j}(t_{-j})x_i(t_i) 
%    \qquad
%    \qquad
%    (\text{if $i\neq j$})

%  \begin{equation}
%    x_i(t_i) h x_{-i}(t_{-i})
%    =
%    x_{-i}(t'_{-i})
%    h
%    (1+t_it_{-i}h^{-\alpha_i})^{\alpha_i^\vee}
%    x_{i}(t'_i)
%  \end{equation}
%  where the precise values of the non-zero complex numbers $t'_i$ and $t'_{-i}$% is irrelevant to our computation.
%  Iterating these it is straightforward to see that
%  \[
%    g^\iota 
%    = 
%    x_{-n}(t'_{-n})
%    \cdots
%    x_{-1}(t'_{-1})
%    h^{-1}
%    v_1^{\alpha^\vee_1}
%    \dots
%    v_n^{\alpha^\vee_n}
%    x_1(t'_1)
%    \dots
%    x_n(t'_n)
%  \]
%  where the non-zero complex numbers $v_i$ satisfy the recurrence relation
%  \[
%    v_i 
%    = 
%    1 + t_i t_{-i} h^{\alpha_i}
%    \prod_{j > i} v_j^{-a_{j,i}}.
%  \]

%  To conclude our proof is then sufficient to observe that $h^{\omega_i}\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)$ is $v_i$.

%\end{proof}

In proving the following theorem we make use of the involutive anti-automorphism $g \mapsto g^\iota$ of $G$ defined by
\begin{equation}
  h^\iota := h^{-1}\,\, (h\in H),

  \quad
  x_i(t)^\iota := x_i(t),

  \quad
  x_{-i}(t)^\iota := x_{-i}(t).

Since $\iota$ preserves $B_+$ and $B_-$ but takes any lift of $w \in W$ to a lift of $w^{-1}$, it restricts to a biregular isomorphism between $G^{u,v}$ and $G^{u^{-1},v^{-1}}$. \saySS{Please check my math here: if an iso is defined on an open dense then it is birationa, correct?}\sayHW{You are correct, but here is a better argument for what we want.}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:mainirregular}
The isomorphism $\cA_{B_{dbl}} \cong \kk[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ of Proposition \ref{prop:coordring} takes the preprojective cluster variable $x_{c^k\omega_i}$ to the restriction of the highest-weight minor $\Delta_{c^k\omega_i}$, and the preinjective cluster variable $x_{-c^k \omega_i}$ to the restriction of the lowest-weight minor $\Delta_{-c^k \omega_i}$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In Theorem \ref{thm:exchangerelations} we computed exchange relations that determine these cluster variables in terms of the initial ones, so it suffices to check that the indicated restrictions of minors satisfy the same relations.

If we apply Proposition \ref{prop:fundid} with $u = v = c^k s_1 \cdots s_{i-1}$ and make a substitution following Lemma \ref{lemma:coefficient_identity_powers}, we find that 
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{c^k\omega_i}\Delta_{c^{k+1}\omega_i} = 
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{c^{k+1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{c^k\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
      \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j}
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} 
      \prod_{\ell<j}\big(
        \Delta^{c \omega_\ell}_{\omega_\ell} 
        \Delta^{\omega_\ell}_{c \omega_\ell}
      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    \right)^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]}
\end{equation}
is satisfied on $G^{c,c^{-1}}$. 
Comparing with Equation \ref{eq:preprojective} establishes that $x_{c^k\omega_i} = \Delta_{c^k \omega_i}$.

On the other hand, applying the above argument with $c^{-1}$ in place of $c$ shows that  
\begin{equation} \Delta_{c^{-k}\omega_i} \Delta_{c^{-k-1}\omega_i} = 
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{c^{-k}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{c^{-k-1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
      \Delta^{c^{-1} \omega_j}_{\omega_j}
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c^{-1}\omega_j} 
      \prod_{\ell>j}\big(
        \Delta^{c^{-1} \omega_\ell}_{\omega_\ell} 
        \Delta^{\omega_\ell}_{c^{-1} \omega_\ell}
      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    \right)^{[c^{-k}\beta_i^-:\alpha_j]}
\end{equation}
is satisfied on $G^{c^{-1},c}$. Given that $g \mapsto g^\iota$ exchanges $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ with $G^{c^{-1},c}$ and that $\Delta_\lambda^\mu(g) = \Delta_\mu^\lambda(g^\iota)$, we obtain another identity on $G^{c,c^{-1}}$. Using the substitution of Lemma \ref{lemma:coefficients_identities}, this can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{-c^{-k}\omega_i}\Delta_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_i} =
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{-c^{-k}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
      \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j}
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} 
      \prod_{\ell<j}\big(
        \Delta^{c \omega_\ell}_{\omega_\ell} 
        \Delta^{\omega_\ell}_{c \omega_\ell}
      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    \right)^{[c^{-k}\beta_i^-:\alpha_j]}.
\end{equation}
In particular, the lowest-weight minors $\Delta_{-c^{-k}\omega_i}$ satisfy Equation \ref{eq:preinjective}.

  Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$, for any $i\in[1,n]$, the product $\Delta_{\omega_i}\Delta_{-\omega_i}$ is equal to
  \begin{equation} 
    \Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i}
    \Delta^{\omega_i}_{ c\omega_i} 
    \prod_{j<i}\big(
      \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j} 
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{c \omega_j}
    \big)^{a_{j i}}
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{-\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +1
  \end{equation}
  where all the running indices in the products are in $[1,n]$.

  In view of \Cref{lemma:coefficients_values} and \Cref{lemma:initial_cluster_variables}\sayDR{Missing reference} the identity to prove becomes

  Equivalently, applying $\iota$, we need to show that 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    h^{\omega_i}\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)
    & = &
    t_i
    t_{-i}
    h^{2\omega_i}
    \prod_{j<i}h^{a_{ji}\omega_j}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}(g^\iota)
    +
    1\\
    & = &
    t_i
    t_{-i}
    h^{\alpha_i}
    \prod_{j>i}\Big(h^{\omega_j}\Delta_{\omega_j}(g^\iota)\Big)^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    1
  \end{eqnarray*}

  To compute $\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)$ we need to straighten up the expression of $g^\iota$ using the commutations relations (Cf. \cite[Proposition 7.2]{BZ01})
  \begin{equation}
    x_i(t_i)x_{-j}(t_{-j}) 
    =
    x_{-j}(t_{-j})x_i(t_i) 
    \qquad
    \qquad
    (\text{if $i\neq j$})
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    x_i(t_i) h x_{-i}(t_{-i})
    =
    x_{-i}(t'_{-i})
    h
    (1+t_it_{-i}h^{-\alpha_i})^{\alpha_i^\vee}
    x_{i}(t'_i),
  \end{equation}
  where the precise values of the non-zero complex numbers $t'_i$ and $t'_{-i}$ is irrelevant to our computation.
  Iterating these it is straightforward to see that
  \[
    g^\iota 
    = 
    x_{-n}(t'_{-n})
    \cdots
    x_{-1}(t'_{-1})
    h^{-1}
    v_1^{\alpha^\vee_1}
    \dots
    v_n^{\alpha^\vee_n}
    x_1(t'_1)
    \dots
    x_n(t'_n)
  \]
  where the non-zero complex numbers $v_i$ satisfy the recurrence relation
  \[
    v_i 
    = 
    1 + t_i t_{-i} h^{\alpha_i}
    \prod_{j > i} v_j^{-a_{j,i}}.
  \]

  To conclude our proof it is then sufficient to observe that $h^{\omega_i}\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)$ is $v_i$.
%The statement regarding preprojective cluster variables follows from comparing Equation \ref{eq:preprojective} with Proposition \ref{prop:projective_minors_identity}, using the substitutions given by Equation \ref{eq:initialcluster}.

%\section{Level Zero Representations}
\section{Regular cluster variables as minors}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:level zero}
Let $G = \widehat{LSL_n}$ be the affine Kac-Moody group of type $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$, let $c$ be a Coxeter element of the affine Weyl group, and $Q_c$ the associated affine quiver.  All regular cluster variables in the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ are principal minors of level zero representations.  
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a regular representation $M_{[p,q]}$ compute the strand configuration whose minor has the same $F$-polynomial.
\item Show that the injective copresentation matches the weight of the minor.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Quiver Representations}
  A quiver $Q=(Q_0,Q_1,s,t)$ with $n$ vertices consists of a set $Q_0=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ of vertices, a set $Q_1$ of arrows, and maps $s,t:Q_1\to Q_0$ giving the source and target of an arrow.  
  Given a field $\kk$, a representation $V=(V_i,V_a)$ consists of a $\kk$-vector space $V_i$ for each $i\in Q_0$ and a $\kk$-linear map $V_a:V_{s(a)}\to V_{t(a)}$ for each arrow $a\in Q_1$.  
  A morphism of representation $\theta:V\to W$ consists of a collection of $\kk$-linear maps $\theta_i:V_i\to W_i$ so that $\theta_{t(a)}\circ V_a=W_a\circ \theta_{s(a)}$ for each arrow $a\in Q_1$.  
  When the quiver $Q$ is acyclic (i.e. has no oriented cycles), its category $\rep_\kk Q$ of finite-dimensional representations is particularly nice and thus we assume $Q$ is acyclic throughout.  
  In this case, it is well-known that $\rep_\kk Q$ is a hereditary, abelian, length category with finitely many simple objects.  
  When $Q$ is an orientation of a simply-laced finite-type Dynkin diagram, $\rep_\kk Q$ contains only finitely many indecomposable representations.

  Write $\kk Q$ for the path algebra of $Q$, this is the $\kk$-vector space with basis given by paths (including the trivial paths) in $Q$.  
  The vector space $\kk Q$ has a multiplication given by concatenation of paths and one may identify the module category of $\kk Q$ with $\rep_\kk Q$, but we will not use this here.  
  The path algebra is naturally considered as a representation of $Q$ where the vector space at vertex $i$ is spanned by all paths in $Q$ ending at $i$ and the action of an arrow $a$ is by concatenation.  
  Given a representation $V\in\rep_\kk Q$ and a projective presentation $0\to P_1\to P_0\to V\to 0$ (which terminates after two terms since $\rep_\kk Q$ is hereditary), we define the Auslander-Reiten translate $\tau(V)\in\rep_\kk Q$ via the short exact sequence
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:AR translation}
    0\longrightarrow \tau(V)\longrightarrow D\Hom(P_1,\kk Q)\longrightarrow D\Hom(P_0,\kk Q)\longrightarrow 0,
  \end{equation}
  where $D=\Hom(-,\kk)$ is the standard $\kk$-linear duality functor.

  The AR translation $\tau$ strongly controls the representation theory of $Q$: a representation $P$ is projective if and only if $\tau(P)=0$ and a representation $I$ is injective if and only if it is not of the form $\tau(V)$ for any $V$.  
  Call a representation $V$ preprojective if $\tau^k(V)$ is projective for some $k\ge0$, preinjective\sayDR{post?} if there is an injective representation $I$ so that $V=\tau^k(I)$ for some $k\ge0$, and regular otherwise.  
  When $Q$ is an orientation of a simply-laced finite-type Dynkin diagram, the injective representations are preprojective (hence projective representations are preinjective) and there are no regular representations.  
  When $Q$ is an orientation of a simply-laced affine Dynkin diagram, the regular representations admit a concrete description but to describe it we need more notation.

  Write $\cQ$ for the Grothendieck group of $\rep_\kk Q$ and note that $\cQ$ is a free abelian group generated by the classes $\alpha_i=[S_i]$ of the vertex-simple representations of $Q$.  
  For $V\in\rep_\kk Q$ we thus call $[V]\in\cQ$ its dimension vector.  
  Since $\rep_\kk Q$ is hereditary, the Euler-Ringel form \[\langle V,W\rangle:=\dim_\kk\Hom(V,W)-\dim_\kk\Ext^1(V,W)\] only depends on the dimension vectors of $V$ and $W$.  
  In particular, the Euler-Ringel form is completely determined by the pairing of vertex-simple representations:
  \[\langle S_i,S_j\rangle=\begin{cases}1 & \text{if $i=j$;}\\ -1 & \text{if $i\to j\in Q_1$;}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}\]

  For the remainder of the section we restrict $Q$ to be an orientation of a simply-laced affine Dynkin diagram.
  Identifying $\cQ\cong\ZZ^n$ with the root lattice, we write $\delta\in\cQ$ for the minimal positive imaginary root.
  \begin{lemma}\cite{ASS06}
      A representation $V\in\rep_\kk Q$ is regular if and only if $\langle\delta,V\rangle=0$.
  \end{lemma}

  To prove Proposition~\ref{prop:level zero} we will further restrict $Q$ to be of affine type $\tilde{A}_{n-1}$, that is $Q$ is an acyclic orientation of a cycle.  
  In this case we identify the vertices of $Q$ with $\ZZ_n$, the integers modulo $n$, so that neighboring vertices have consecutive labels.
  Our main interest will be in rigid representations, i.e. $V\in\rep_\kk Q$ such that $\Ext^1(V,V)=0$.  
  In particular, we aim to give a concrete characterization of all rigid indecomposable representations $V$ which are regular.

  The following characterization of rigid indecomposable regular representations appears to be new and may be of independent interest.  For $i,j\in\ZZ_n$ write $[i,j]=\{i,i+1,\ldots,j\}$ and define a representation $V_{[i,j]}$ of $Q$ with one-dimensional vector spaces at each of the vertices in $[i,j]$ and identity maps between neighboring vector spaces.
  \begin{proposition}
    Let $V$ be a rigid indecomposable regular representation of an acyclic quiver $Q$ of affine type $\tilde{A}_{n-1}$.  
    Then there are $i,j\in Q_0$ with $[i,j]\subsetneq[1,n]$ containing the same number of sinks and sources of $Q$ so that $V\cong V_{[i,j]}$. 
  \end{proposition}
  \begin{proof}\mbox{}
    To begin we recall the structure of the subcategory $\cR\subset\rep_\kk Q$ consisting of the regular representations.  
    Suppose that $Q$ contains $p$ clockwise arrows and $q$ counterclockwise arrows.  
    Then $\cR$ is equivalent the direct product of three categories: the category of nilpotent representations of an oriented $p$-cycle, the category of nilpotent representations of an oriented $q$-cycle, and the category of invertible representations of the Jordan quiver (this is the quiver with a single vertex and a single loop based at this vertex so that an invertible representation is specified by a single invertible matrix).\sayDR{For uniformity I am separating the standard $\PP^1$-family of homogeneous tubes for the Kronecker quiver into nilpotent ``north pole'' representations, nilpotent ``south pole'' representations, and ``invertible'' representations.}

    Any invertible representation $M$ of the Jordan quiver has nontrivial self-extensions given by block upper triangular matrices with two copies of $M$ on the diagonal, in particular there are no rigid representations in this component.
    For representations of $Q$ in this component, the dimension of the vector space at each vertex is equal and all maps are invertible.
    From the considerations above, such representations are never rigid.
    
    Now consider the category $\cC$ of nilpotent representations of an oriented $k$-cycle.  
    Write $\tilde\cC$ for the category of finite-dimensional representations of the equioriented bi-infinite $A_{\infty,\infty}$ quiver.  
    For any choice of base point, there is an essentially surjective exact functor $\pi:\tilde\cC\to\cC$ given by ``wrapping around'' the $k$-cycle (nilpotency guarantees the essential surjectivity).  
    Now consider a nilpotent representation $V$ of the $k$-cycle which is sincere (i.e. every vertex contains a nontrivial vector space).
    Choose a lift $\tilde V\in\tilde\cC$ of $V$ in which every indecomposable summand has support intersecting a given fundamental domain and write $\tilde V'$ for the lift of $V$ obtained by shifting $\tilde V$ to the right by $k$ vertices.  
    Since $V$ was sincere, it is easy to see that $\tilde\cC$ contains a nontrivial extension of $\tilde V$ by $\tilde V'$, in particular $\Ext^1(V,V)\ne 0$ since $\pi$ is exact.  
    For $k=p$ ($k=q$ is handled similarly), the representations of $Q$ in this component have isomorphisms at each of the $q$ counterclockwise arrows\sayDR{It feels a little funny to think that the zero map between zero vector spaces is an isomorphism but it's true.} and are sincere as representations of the $k$-cycle if and only if they are sincere as representations of $Q$.

    Following the discussion above we see that a regular representation of $Q$ is rigid only if it is non-sincere.  
    Since a non-sincere representation of $Q$ can be identified with a representation of a Dynkin quiver of type $A$, any rigid indecomposable regular representation of $Q$ must be of the form $V_{[i,j]}$ for some $i,j\in Q_0$ with $[i,j]\subsetneq[1,n]$.  

    It only remains to observe the condition on sinks and sources in $[i,j]$.  
    Write $C,K\subset Q_0$ for the subset of source and sinks in $Q$ respectively. 
    For any representation $V$ we have  
    \[\langle\delta,V\rangle=\sum_{i\in Q_0}\dim V_i-\sum_{a\in Q_1}\dim V_{t(a)}=\sum_{i\in C}\dim V_i-\sum_{i\in K}\dim V_i.\]
    For regular $V$, we have $\langle\delta,V\rangle=0$ and so $\sum\limits_{i\in C}\dim V_i=\sum\limits_{i\in K}\dim V_i$.
  \end{proof}



\subsection{Networks}

We will study generalized minors by modeling them with weighted networks on a cylinder. A graph is weighted if all of its edges are assigned elements of a fixed ring; below this will be the Laurent polynomial ring $\CC[t_{\pm1}^{\pm1},\dotsc,t_{\pm n}^{\pm1},h_1^{\pm1},\dotsc,h_n^{\pm1}]$ with $3n$ polynomial generators.

\begin{definition}
Given $c = s_{\sigma_1} \dotsc s_{\sigma_n}$, define the \emph{network} $\cN_c$ to be the following weighted directed graph on the cylinder. 
We describe it as the concatenation of subgraphs on cylinders associated to the factors in the decomposition 
\[g=x_{-\sigma_1}(t_{-\sigma_1})\cdots x_{-\sigma_n}(t_{-\sigma_n}) hx_{\sigma_n}(t_{\sigma_n}) \cdots x_{\sigma_1}(t_{\sigma_1}),\]
where $h$ factors as $\prod\limits_{i=1}^n h_i$ with $h_i=\big(h^{\omega_i}\big)^{\alpha_i^\vee}$.  
Note that $h_i^{\omega_i}=h^{\omega_i}$ and $h_i^{\omega_j}=1$ for $i\ne j$.  
We will abuse notation slightly and write $h_i$ also for the value $h_i^{\omega_i}$.

Each subcylinder has $n$ non-crossing \emph{horizontal} edges running from one boundary component to the other which are oriented from right to left and labeled by $\ZZ_n$ compatibly with their cyclic ordering.  
The subcylinder associated to $x_{\pm i}(t_{\pm i})$ contains a (\emph{vertical}) \emph{bridge} with weight $t_{\pm i}$ joining the $(i-1)^{st}$ horizontal edge and the $i^{th}$ horizontal edge, this bridge is oriented upward for $i$ and downward for $-i$.  
In the subcylinder associated to $h_i$, the $i^{th}$ edge has weight $h_i^{-1}$ and the $(i-1)^{st}$ edge has weight $h_i$.  
All other edges in a subcylinder are taken to have weight 1.

By a path in $\cN_c$ we will mean a path which is directed compatibly with the edges of $\cN_c$, and which begins at a source on one end of the cyclinder and ends at a sink on the other end. 
If $P = \{P_i\}$ is a collection of paths, we write $\partial_{in}P \subset \ZZ_n$ for the set of boundary sources at which paths in $P$ begin; similarly $\partial_{out}P \subset \ZZ_n$ denotes the set of boundary sinks. 
We say the weight of a path is the product of the weights of edges it traverses, and the weight $wt(P)$ of a collection of paths is the product of the weights of its constituent paths.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:minorsfrompaths}
Given $S \subset \ZZ_n$, let
\[ \omega_S = \sum_{i \in S} \omega_{i+1} - \omega_i.\] 
Then for generic $g\in G^{c,c^{-1}}$ we have \[ \Delta_{\omega_S}(g) = \sum_{P: S \to S} wt(P), \]
where the sum is over collections $P$ of pairwise disjoint paths with $\partial_{in}P = \partial_{out}P = S$.
%$|S|$-tuples of non-intersecting paths in $\cN_c$ with input and output sets equal to $S$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By construction, the directed graph $\cN_c$ encodes the action of $g$ in the standard basis $\{ e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_k} z^\ell\}$ of $\big(\!\bigwedge^{\!k}\CC^n\big)[z^{\pm 1}]$. 
This basis is labeled by pairs of a $k$-element subset of $\ZZ_n$ and an integer $\ell$.
\end{proof}

To use the above proposition effectively, we collect some elementary combinatorial observations about non-crossing paths $P$ in $\cN_c$. 
We define $\phi(P) \subset \ZZ_n$ by letting $j \in \phi(P)$ if and only if a path in $P$ traverses the unique bridge of weight $t_j$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:phi}
  Let $P$ be a collection of pairwise disjoint paths in $\cN_c$.  Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $i\in\partial_{in}P$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item if $i\to i+1$ in $Q$ or $i\notin\phi(P)$, then $i+1\notin\phi(P)$;
      \item if $i+1\to i$ in $Q$ and $i+1\in\phi(P)$, then $i\in\phi(P)$;
      \item[(b')] if  $i+1\in\phi(P)$, then $i+1\to i$ in $Q$ and $i\in\phi(P)$;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item For $i\notin\partial_{in}P$: 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item if $i\in\phi(P)$, then $i\to i+1$ in $Q$ and $i+1\in\phi(P)$.\\
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $i \to i+1$ in $Q$, $i \in \phi(P)$, and $i \notin \partial_{in}(P)$, then $i + 1 \in \phi(P)$.
    \item If $i \to i+1$ in $Q$ and $i \in \partial_{in}P$, then $i +1 \notin \phi(P)$.
    \item If $i+1 \to i$ in $Q$, $i \in \partial_{in}P$, and $i+1 \in \phi(P)$, then $i \in \phi(P)$.
    \item If $i \notin \phi(P)$ and $i \in \partial_{in}P$, then $i +1 \notin \phi(P)$.

\sayDR{Move this into the section on tubes?}Recall that the regular cluster variables are labeled by intervals $[p,q] \subset \ZZ_n$ containing as many sources as sinks -- to such an interval we associate a boundary condition on paths in $\cN_c$:

\begin{definition}\label{def:Spq}
Let $[p,q] \subset \ZZ_n$ be an interval containing an even number of sinks and sources; that is, such that $M_{[p,q]}$ is regular. Write $k_1 < \cdots < k_m$ (resp. $c_1 < \cdots < c_m$) for the indices of the sinks (resp. sources) in $[p,q]$. Let $S_{[p,q]}$ denote the following subset of $\ZZ_n$:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the first sink in $[p,q]$ comes before the first source (i.e. $k_1 < c_1$ in $[p,q]$), then 
\[
S_{[p,q]} = [q,p-2] \cup [k_1, c_1 -1] \cup \cdots \cup [k_m, c_m - 1].
\]
\item If the first source in $[p,q]$ comes before the first sink (i.e. $c_1 < k_1$ in $[p,q]$),
\[
S_{[p,q]} = [p,c_1-1] \cup [k_1,c_2-1] \cup \cdots \cup [k_m,q].
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The above definition is determined by the following property:
\begin{proposition}
Let 
\[
M_{[p,q]} \to \bigoplus I_j^{a_j} \to \bigoplus I_j^{b_j}
\]
be the minimal injective resolution of $M_{[p,q]}$. Then
\[
\sum_j (b_j - a_j)\omega_j = \sum_{i \in S_{[p,q]}} \omega_{i+1} - \omega_i.
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
As in Definition \ref{def:Spq}, we let $k_1 < \cdots < k_m$, $c_1 < \cdots < c_m$ be the labels of the sinks and sources in $[p,q]$. If $k_1 < c_1$ in $[p,q]$, then the minimal injective resolution of $M_{[p,q]}$ is
\[
M_{[p,q]} \to I_q \oplus I_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus I_{k_m} \to I_{p-1} \oplus I_{c_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus I_{c_m}.
\]
\end{proof}

We now turn to the main result of the section:

\begin{theorem}\sayDR{Merge this into Prop.~\ref{prop:level zero} and move the proof into the proof section below.}
If $M_{[p,q]}$ is regular, then under the isomorphism $\CC[G^{c,c^{-1}}] \cong A_Q$ we have
\[ x_{M_{[p,q]}} = \Delta_{\omega_{S_{[p,q]}}}\]  
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\cP = \{P: S_{[p,q]} \to S_{[p,q]}\}$ denote the set of pairwise disjoint collections of paths in $\cN_c$ with $\partial_{in}P = \partial_{out}P = S_{[p,q]}$. 
By Proposition \ref{prop:minorsfrompaths}, for a generic element 
\[g = x_{-\sigma_0}(t_{-\sigma_0})\cdots x_{-\sigma_n}(t_{-\sigma_n}) hx_{\sigma_n}(t_{\sigma_n}) \cdots x_{\sigma_0}(t_{\sigma_0})\]
the evaluation $\Delta_{\omega_{S_{[p,q]}}}(g)$ is the weighted sum 
\[
\Delta_{\omega_{S_{[p,q]}}}(g) = \sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}} wt(P).
\]
As in Theorem~\ref{???}, let $\cE = \{ E \subset [p,q]\}$ denote the subsets of $E \subset [p,q]$ that are target-closed: if there is an arrow $i \to j$ in $Q$ and $i, j$ are in $[p,q]$, then $E$ must contain $j$ if it contains $i$. 
% $i \in E$, $j \in [p,q]$, and there is an arrow from $i$ to $j$ in $Q$, then $j \in E$. 
Then we have 
\[
x_{M_{[p,q]}} = x^g \sum_{E \in \cE} \prod_{i \in E} \hat{y}_i.
\]\sayDR{Using $g$ here for the $g$-vector is an abuse of notation.}

As in Lemma \ref{lem:phi}, we define $\phi(P) \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ by letting $j \in \phi(P)$ if and only if a path in $P$ traverses the unique edge of weight $t_j$. We claim that for $P \in \cP$, $\phi(P)$ is in fact a subset of $[p,q]$, is target-closed in $[p,q]$, and that the assignment $P \mapsto \phi(P)$ defines a bijection $\cP \cong \cE$.

%Recall that $\cN_c$ consists of parallel strands labeled by $\Z_{n+1}$ connecting the two boundary components of the cylinder, and two sets of $n+1$ vertical strands connecting them. One of those sets has edges weighted $t_j$, and with 

%Recall that for $P \in \cP$ and any $j \in \Z_{n+1}$, $wt(P)$ either does not depend on $t_j$ or is linear in $t_j$. 

%Let $\phi(P) \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ denote the set of indices $j$ such that $wt(P)$ depends non-trivially on $t_j$. Recall that $t_j$ appears as the weight of a unique edge in $\cN_c$, so equivalently $\phi(P)$ records which of these edges are traversed by a path in $P$. We claim that $\phi(P)$ is in fact a subset of $[p,q]$, is target-closed in $[p,q]$, and that the assignment $P \mapsto \phi(P)$ defines a bijection $\cP \cong \cE$.

As in Definition \ref{def:Spq}, we let $k_1 < \cdots < k_m$, $c_1 < \cdots < c_m$ denote the labels of the sinks and sources in $[p,q]$. We first consider the case where the first sink in $[p,q]$ comes before the first source (i.e. $k_1 < c_1$ in $[p,q]$). Recall that in this case
\[
S_{[p,q]} = [q,p-2] \cup [k_1, c_1 -1] \cup \cdots \cup [k_m, c_m - 1].
\]

Let $P \in \cP$. By assumption we have $q \to q+1$ in $Q$; $q \in \partial_{in}P$ then implies $q+1 \notin \phi(P)$ by item (3) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi}. Then since $[q+1,p-2] \subset \partial_{in}P$, it follows inductively from item (4) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi} that $[q+2,p-1] \not\subset \phi(P)$, hence $\phi(P) \subset [p,q]$.

If $i, i+1 \in [p,q]$ and $i \to i+1 \in Q$, then by inspection $i \notin \partial_{in}P$; item (1) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi} then implies that if $i \in \phi(P)$, we also have $i+1 \in \phi(P)$. If instead $i \leftarrow i+1$, then by inspection $i \in \partial_{in}P$; item (2) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi} then implies that if $i +1 \in \phi(P)$, we also have $i \in \phi(P)$. Putting these facts together we see that $\phi(P)$ is target-closed in $[p,q]$.

Suppose now that $E \in \cE$ is a target-closed subset of $[p,q]$. We define a collection $P \in \cP$ with $\phi(P) = E$ by specifying the path $P_i \in P$ which begins at boundary source $i \in S_{[p,q]}$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $i \in [q+1,p-2]$ then $P_i$ stays on level $i$.
\item If $i \in \{q,k_1,\dotsc,k_m\}$ and $i \notin E$, then $P_i$ stays on level $i$.
\item If $i \in \{q,k_1,\dotsc,k_m\}$ and $i \notin E$, let $j \in E$ be the index such that $[j,i] \subset E$ is the largest interval in $E$ with $k \to k+1$ in $Q$ for all $k \in [j,i-1]$. Then $P_i$ begins on level $i$, follows bridges up to level $j-1$, then returns to end on level $i$.
\item If $i$ is not of the above form, then  $P_i$ stays on level $i$ if $i \notin E$ and moves from level $i$ to level $i-1$ and back if $i \in E$.
\end{enumerate}

\sayHW{Things not addressed yet: why is $P \mapsto \phi(E)$ injective on $\cP$, why is the above prescription for $P$ actually in $\cP$, what about the other tube?}

% Since the total number of sinks and sources in $[p,q]$ is even, it follows that $Q$ has an arrow $q \to q+1$.

\section{Appendix: Cluster Algebras --- OLD STUFF TO BE REMOVED}
Let $A$ be any irreducible Cartan matrix of infinite type and let $c=s_1\dots s_n$ be a Coxeter element in the Weyl group of $A$. 
Because of the assumption, any prefix of the infinite word $c^\infty$ is reduced. 
The letters of $c^\infty$ (and thus its prefixes) are naturally labeled by pair of integers $(k,m)$ with $1\leq k\leq n$ and $m\geq 0$ where the element $c^ms_1\dots s_k$ corresponds to the indices $(k,m)$. 
\saySS{We should be able to do this also in finite type replacing prefixes with reduced words.}
Let $\cAb(B_c)$ be the cluster algebra with principal coefficients associated to $c$.
\saySS{We may want to settle the notation that relates $B_c$ to $A$ and $c$ once and for all in some notation section.}

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{preprojective} cluster variables of $\cAb(B_c)$ are the cluster variables obtained by mutating along the word $c^\infty$.
  Namely $x_{k,m}$ is the cluster variable obtained from the initial cluster by mutating the cluster variables $x_{1,0},x_{2,0},\ldots,x_{n,0},x_{1,1}$ through $x_{k,m}$.
  \saySS{This phrasing sucks but I am fighting the blank page at the moment.}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  The preprojective cluster variables of $\cAb(B_c)$ satisfy the exchange relations
  \begin{equation}
    x_{k,m-1}x_{k,m} = \prod_{i<k}x_{i,m}^{-a_{i,k}} \prod_{i>k}x_{i,m-1}^{-a_{i,k}} + \prod_{j\in I}y_j^{[c^{m-1}\beta_k^+:\alpha_j]}
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
This follows immediately from the following Lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{le:positive mutations}
  Let $\tilde B=\left[\begin{array}{c} B\\ M\end{array}\right]$ denote an $m\times n$ ($m\ge n)$ exchange matrix with $b_{ik}\le0$ for $1\le i\le n$ and $m_{ik}\ge0$ for $n+1\le i\le m$.  Writing $\mu_k\tilde B=\left[\begin{array}{c} B'\\ M'\end{array}\right]$ we have $M'=MF_k$ where $F_k=(f_{ij})$ with $f_{ij}=\begin{cases}1 & \text{if $i=j\ne k$;}\\ -1 & \text{if $i=j=k$;}\\ b_{kj} & \text{if $i=k$;}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$
\end{lemma}
Define the $2n\times n$ matrix $\tilde B_{k,m}=\mu_k\mu_{k-1}\cdots\mu_1(\mu_n\cdots\mu_1)^m\left[\begin{array}{c} B_c\\ I_n\end{array}\right]$ for $0\le k\le n-1$ and $m\in\ZZ$.  Write $\gamma^{(k,m)}_j\in\ZZ^n$ for the last $n$ rows of the $j^th$ column of $\tilde B_{k,m}$, where we identify $\ZZ^n$ with the root lattice.  These are the $c$-vectors of $\tilde B_{k,m}$.
\begin{lemma}\mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The principal part of column $k$ in $\tilde B_{k,m}$ is weakly positive while the principal part of column $k+1$ is weakly negative (with the convention that column $0$ refers to the last column of $\tilde B_{k,m}$).
    \item The $c$-vectors of $\tilde B_{k,m}$ are given by 
    \[\gamma^{(k,m)}_j=\begin{cases}c^m s_1\cdots s_k\alpha_j & \text{if $m\ge0$;}\\\alpha_j & \text{if $m=-1$ and $j\le k$;}\\-\alpha_j & \text{if $m=-1$ and $j>k$;}\\-c^{m+1} s_1\cdots s_k\alpha_j & \text{if $m<-1$.}\end{cases}\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first claim is essentially the statement that the sequence $1,\ldots,n$ (resp. $n,\ldots,1$) is sink (resp. source) adapted for $Q$.

  For the final claim we work by induction on the length of the mutation sequence.  For $k=m=0$ we have $\gamma^{(0,0)}_j=\alpha_j$ is exactly the $j^{th}$ column of the identity matrix.  For the general case we claim that
  \[\gamma^{(k,m)}_j=s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}\big(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j\big).\]

  To see this, recall that the pairing $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is $W$-invariant, in particular we have $(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j,\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k)=(\alpha_j,\alpha_k)$.  Using this we may compute
  \begin{align*}
    s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}\big(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j\big)
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j-\frac{(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k,\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j)}{2(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k,\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k)}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k\\
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j-\frac{(\alpha_k,\alpha_j)}{2(\alpha_k,\alpha_k)}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k\\
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j-a_{kj}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k\\
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j+b_{kj}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k.
  \end{align*}
  
  Thus the claim follows from Lemma~\ref{le:positive mutations} \sayDR{Cite [Nakanishi-Zelevinsky, Prop. 1.3] instead}.  To conclude the proof we note that 
  \[s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}=c^m s_1\cdots s_{k-1} s_k s_{k-1}\cdots s_1 c^{-m}\]
  and thus applying the induction hypothesis
  \[\gamma^{(k,m)}_j=s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}\big(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j\big)=c^m s_1\cdots s_k\alpha_j.\]
\end{proof}


\section{Appendix: Quiver Representations}

\subsection{Affine Tubes}\sayDR{Clean up this section.}
  
  For a vertex $i$ in $Q$, write $i_+$ for the next vertex of $Q$ counterclockwise from $i$ and write $i^+$ for the next source or sink of $Q$ counterclockwise from $i$.  Define $i_-$ and $i^-$ similarly by looking clockwise from $i$.  Note that $t(\vec{a}_\ell)_+=s(\vec{a}_\ell)$ and $t(\cev{a}_\ell)_-=s(\cev{a}_\ell)$.  Also note that when $i$ is a source (resp. a sink) in $Q$, both $i^-$ and $i^+$ will be sinks (resp. sources) in $Q$.  

  For vertices $i$ and $j$ in $Q$, write $[i,j]\subset Q_0$ for the subset of vertices contained weakly between $i$ and $j$ when tracing counterclockwise around $Q$ from $i$ to $j$.  Define $(i,j)$, $(i,j]$, and $[i,j)$ similarly.  Let $M_{[i,j]}$ denote the indecomposable representation of $Q$ which contains a one-dimensional vector space at each vertex $k\in[i,j]$ and a nonzero map at each arrow traversed from $i$ to $j$.  In particular, $\{i,j\}\subset\supp\soc\big(M_{[i,j]}\big)\cup\supp\top\big(M_{[i,j]}\big)$ and we take $M_{[i,i]}$ to be the simple representation $S_i$ at vertex $i$.  When enumerating over the elements of $[i,j]$ we will usually write $\sum\limits_{k=i}^j$ instead of the more proper $\sum\limits_{k\in[i,j]}$.

  For $\ell\in\ZZ$ define indecomposable representations $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:=M_{[s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1}),t(\vec{a}_\ell)]}$ and $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:=M_{[t(\cev{a}_\ell),s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})]}$.  Note that when $t(\vec{a}_\ell)$ (resp. $t(\cev{a}_\ell)$) is not a sink in $Q$ the representation $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}$ (resp. $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}$) will be simple and otherwise $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}$ (resp. $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}$) will be a string module with socle $S_{t(\vec{a}_\ell)}$ (resp. $S_{t(\cev{a}_\ell)}$) and top $S_{s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1})}$ (resp. $S_{s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})}$).  From this we see that the collections $\{\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le p\}$ and $\{\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le q\}$ give families of pairwise orthogonal bricks, i.e. there are no nonzero morphisms between non-isomorphic representations and each of these representations has trivial endomorphism ring.

  Denote by $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ (resp. $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$) the full, extension-closed, additive subcategory of $\rep Q$, called the \emph{clockwise} (resp. \emph{counterclockwise}) \emph{tubular subcategory} (tube), generated by $\{\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le p\}$ (resp. $\{\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le q\}$).  Following \cite[Section 3.1]{Rin84} the clockwise and counterclockwise tubes are serial, abelian categories with simple objects given by $\{\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le p\}$ and $\{\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le q\}$ respectively.  In each case these ``simple'' objects form the mouth of the corresponding tubular categories.

  For $\ell\in\ZZ$, label the dimension vector of the ``simple'' object $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}$ as
  \begin{equation}
    \vec{\beta}_{1,\ell}=\sum_{i=s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1})}^{t(\vec{a}_\ell)}\alpha_i
  \end{equation}
  and the dimension vector of the ``simple'' object $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}$ as
  \begin{equation}
    \cev{\beta}_{1,\ell}=\sum_{i=t(\cev{a}_\ell)}^{s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})}\alpha_i.
  \end{equation}
  The coindices of these representations can be described as follows:
  \begin{align}
    \vec{\lambda}_{1,\ell}&=\omega_{t(\vec{a}_\ell)}-\omega_{s(\vec{a}_\ell)}\\
    \cev{\lambda}_{1,\ell}&=\omega_{t(\cev{a}_\ell)}-\omega_{s(\cev{a}_\ell)}.
  \end{align}

  Define indecomposable representations $\vec{M}_{k,\ell}$ and $\cev{M}_{k,\ell}$ for $k\ge0$ and $\ell\in\ZZ$ inductively via the short exact sequences
  \[0\longrightarrow\vec{M}_{k-1,\ell}\longrightarrow\vec{M}_{k,\ell}\longrightarrow\vec{M}_{1,k+\ell-1}\longrightarrow0\]
  and
  \[0\longrightarrow\cev{M}_{k-1,\ell}\longrightarrow\cev{M}_{k,\ell}\longrightarrow\cev{M}_{1,k+\ell-1}\longrightarrow0.\]
  It follows that the dimension vectors of these representations are given for $1\le k\le p-1$ by
  \begin{align}
    \vec\beta_{k,\ell}=\sum_{m=1}^k\vec\beta_{1,\ell+m-1}=\sum_{i=s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1})}^{t(\vec{a}_{k+\ell-1})}\alpha_i
  \end{align}
  and for $1\le k\le q-1$ by
  \begin{align}
    \cev\beta_{k,\ell}=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\cev\beta_{1,\ell+m-1}=\sum_{i=t(\cev{a}_{k+\ell-1})}^{s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})}\alpha_i.
  \end{align}
  Similarly the coindices of these representations can be computed for $1\le k\le p-1$ as
  \begin{align}
    \vec\lambda_{k,\ell}
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\vec\lambda_{1,\ell+m-1}\\
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\omega_{t(\vec{a}_{\ell+m-1})}-\omega_{s(\vec{a}_{\ell+m-1})}
  \end{align}
  and for $1\le k\le q-1$ as
  \begin{align}
    \cev\lambda_{k,\ell}
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\cev\lambda_{1,\ell+m-1}\quad\text{}\\
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\omega_{t(\cev{a}_{\ell+m-1})}-\omega_{s(\cev{a}_{\ell+m-1})}.
  \end{align}

  \begin{proposition}\mbox{}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The modules listed above provide a complete set of simple objects in the categories $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ and $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$.  Moreover, every object of $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ and $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$ admits a unique Jordan-H\"older series with the corresponding ``simples'' as composition factors.
      \item The indecomposable, rigid regular representations of $Q$ are exactly the representations from $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ and $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$ of length at most $q-1$ and $p-1$ respectively, where length refers to the Jordan-H\"older length in the respective categories.

  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Cite Ringel's ``Tame Algebras and Integral Quadratic Forms''?  \cite[Theorem 3.6.5]{Rin84} where the described generators form the base of the tubes.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}
  \begin{remark}\label{rem:rigid regulars}
    Note that none of the rigid regular representations is sincere and all of them take the form $M_{[i,j]}$ for some $i$ and $j$ with $i\ne j_+$.
  \end{remark}

  \begin{corollary}
    A representation $M$ of $Q$ is regular if and only if $\sum\limits_{\ell=1}^r\dim M_{i_\ell}$ is even.
  \end{corollary}

  The next goal is to enumerate the subrepresentations of each rigid $M_{[i,j]}$.  

  The minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ can be understood in terms of the quiver $Q_{[i,j]}$ as well.  This requires a couple of cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $i$ and $j$ are sinks in $Q_{[i,j]}$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s+1}{2}} I_{j_{2t-1}}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a sink in $Q_{[i,j]}$ and $j$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t-1}}\longrightarrow I_{j+1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a sink in $Q_{[i,j]}$ and $j$ is a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t-1}}\longrightarrow \bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a sink in $Q_{[i,j]}$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{i-1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a sink in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{i-1}\oplus I_{j+1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{j+1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{i-1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ and $j$ are sources in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
  \end{itemize}

  Call a vertex $i$ of a connected subquiver $Q'$ of $Q$ an \emph{internal source of $Q'$} if $i$ is a source of $Q$ and $Q'$ contains a sink both clockwise and counterclockwise from $i$.
  \begin{lemma}\mbox{}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item For $1\le k\le p-1$ we have
      \[\vec{\lambda}_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i\in I}\omega_i-\sum_{i\in O}\omega_i\]
      where $I$ denotes the sinks in the support quiver $Q_{k,\ell}$ of $\vec{M}_{k,\ell}$ and $O$ denotes the set of internal sources of $\vec{Q}_{k,\ell}$ together with $s(\vec{a}_{k+\ell-1})$.
      \item For $1\le k\le q-1$ we have
      \[\cev{\lambda}_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i\in I}\omega_i-\sum_{i\in O}\omega_i\]
      where $I$ denotes the sinks in the support quiver $Q_{k,\ell}$ of $\cev{M}_{k,\ell}$ and $O$ denotes the set of internal sources of $\cev{Q}_{k,\ell}$ together with $s(\cev{a}_{k+\ell-1})$.

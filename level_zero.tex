\section{Introduction}

Given a finite quiver $Q$ without oriented cycles, there is an associated group $G$: the Kac-Moody group whose Dynkin diagram is the underlying unoriented graph of $Q$. The representation theory of $Q$ is connected to $G$ and its Lie algebra in a range of ways; for example, one has the classical result of [BGP] that if $Q$ is of ADE type, its irreducible representations are classified by the positive roots of $G$. In this paper we explore a new relationship, suggested by the results of \cite{YZ08} in finite type. Broadly speaking, we will be interested in the interplay between the following two trichotomies in the representation theories of $Q$ and $G$.

%The relationship is naturally stated in the language of cluster algebras, and takes the form on an interplay between two trichotomies in the representation theory of quivers and Kac-Moody groups: the classification of indecomposable $Q$-representations as preprojective, preinjective, or regular, and the classication of irreducible $G$-representations (say, in affine type) as positive-level, negative-level, or level zero.

Recall that the representation theory of $Q$, or any finite-dimensional algebra, is organized by the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau: \mathrm{Rep}\: Q \to \mathrm{Rep}\: Q$ \cite{ASS06}. An indecomposable representation $M$ is projective if and only if $\tau(M) = 0$, and is injective if and only if $M$ is not of the form $\tau(N)$ for some $N$. With this in mind one says $M$ is preprojective if $\tau^k(M) = 0$ for $k >> 0$, preinjective if it is not of the form $\tau^k(N)$ for $k >> 0$, and regular otherwise. Preprojective and preinjective representations coincide exactly when $Q$ is of ADE type, in which case there are no regular representations. 

On the other hand, the representation theory of $G$ is largely centered around its (dual) categories of highest- and lowest-weight representations [KP, Kum]. These coincide exactly when $G$ is a simple algebraic group, in which case they include all representations of $G$ with finite-dimensional weight spaces. In general $G$ has many other such representations, which are only well-understood when $G$ is of affine type [Cha]. In this case, an irreducible representation is highest-weight, lowest-weight, or neither if its level (the character by which $Z(G) \cong \CC^\times$ acts) is positive, negative, or zero.

%While the full representation theory of $G$ is in general not well-understood, it has a well-behaved category of highest weight representations. These share many properties of finite-dimensional representations of simple Lie groups, which they specialize to when $G$ is finite-dimensional. There is a dual subcategory of lowest-weight representations. These categories coincide if and only if $G$ is finite-dimensional, in which case they encompass all representations with finite-dimensional weight spaces. Aside from this case, a complete description of all such representations exists only when $Q$ is of affine type. In this case $G$ is the central $\CC^\times$-extension of a loop group, and irreducible representations are categorized by their level: the character by which the center acts. 

We connect these two classifications by passing through the cluster algebra $\cA_Q$ \cite{FZ02}. 
This is an algebra equipped with a (partial) canonical basis whose elements are called cluster variables. 
%The relationship we study is mediated by the cluster algebra $\cA_Q$. 
From the perspective of $G$, an orientation of its Dynkin diagram is equivalent to a choice of Coxeter element $c$ in its Weyl group; the cluster algebra $\cA_Q$ (with suitable frozen variables) is the coordinate ring of the double Bruhat cell  $$G^{c,c^{-1}} := B_+ c B_+ \cap B_- c^{-1} B_- \subset G,$$
where $B_+$ and $B_-$ are the usual opposite Borel subgroups [BFZ, Wil]. 
The varieties $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ generalize the space of tridiagonal matrices with determinant equal to one, which they recover when $G=SL_n$ and $c$ is the standard Coxeter element.

From the perspective of $Q$, $\cA_Q$ is a repository for information about the submodule structure of representations of $Q$. 
After embedding $\cA_Q$ into the ring of Laurent polynomials in the initial cluster variables, the remaining cluster variables are in bijection with the rigid indecomposable representations of $Q$ [CC, CK]. 
This correspondence takes a quiver representation to a generating function of the Euler characteristics of its varieties of submodules. 
This expression is called the cluster character of the representation, and with this in mind we refer to a cluster variable as preprojective, preinjective, or regular according to the classification of its associated representation. 
Given the description of $\cA_Q$ as the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$, we see in particular that representations of $Q$ naturally label functions on a subvariety of $G$.

%. To $c$ we associate the double Bruhat cell $$G^{c,c^{-1}} := B_+ c B_+ \cap B_- c^{-1} B_- \subset G,$$ and $\cA_Q$ can be identified with the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ (for suitable coefficients). On the other hand, a cluster algebra is equipped with a set of distinguished elements, cluster variables, which can be completed to a basis of $\cA_Q$ in various interesting ways. The (non-initial) cluster variables in $\cA_Q$ are in bijection with the rigid indecomposable representations of $Q$: $\cA_Q$ is canonically embedded in a Laurent polynomial ring, and to a representation we assign a generating function of Euler characteristics of its varieties of subrepresentations; we refer to a cluster variable as preprojective, preinjective, or regular according to its associated representation. In summary, representations of $Q$ label functions on a subvariety of $G$.

When $Q$ is of ADE type and $G$ a simple algebraic group, Yang and Zelevinsky showed these functions have an interpretation in terms of the representation theory of $G$: they are restrictions of generalized minors. 
These are functions on $G$ labeled by a representation $V$ together with an extremal one-dimensional weight space $V_\lambda$. 
Their value on $g \in G$ is the ratio of any $v \in V_\lambda$ with the projection of $gv \in V$ to $V_\lambda$. 
Our main result is that cluster variables in $\cA_Q$ are also realized as generalized minors on $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ when $Q$ is not finite type, and that moreover the resulting correspondence between quiver representations and group representations intertwines the classifications described above: 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:maintheorem}
Let $Q$ be a finite quiver without oriented cycles and $G^{c,c^{-1}} \subset G$ the associated Coxeter double Bruhat cell.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The preprojective and initial cluster variables in $\cA_Q \cong \CC[G^{c,c^{-1}}]$ are restrictions of generalized minors of highest-weight representations of $G$. The preinjective\sayDR{I am in favor of writing postinjective because for me the AR-translation always goes from right to left, any objections?} cluster variables are restrictions of generalized minors of lowest-weight representations of $G$.
\item Suppose $Q$ is an acyclic orientation of an $n$-cycle, so that $G$ is the central extension of the loop group $LSL_{n}$. Then the regular cluster variables are restrictions of generalized minors of level zero representations of $G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Though above we have taken $G$ to be symmetric for simplicity, part (1) also holds in the symmetrizable case upon replacing quiver-theoretic notions with their species-theoretic counterparts. 
We emphasize that although the coordinate ring of any double Bruhat cell $G^{u,v}$ is an (upper) cluster algebra, its defining quiver is generally not an orientation of the Dynkin diagram of $G$, and one expects that most cluster variables are not restrictions of minors.

While the proof of (1) is mostly a straighforward generalization of the finite-type case (though of course, the distinction between preprojective and preinjective disappears there), the proof of (2) requires different methods. 
%The most interesting part of the Theorem is (2), in the sense that the proof of (1) is an immediate generalization of the finite-type case (though of course, the distinction between preprojective and preinjective disappears there). 
The reason (1) is true is that the preprojective and preinjective cluster variables are determined by an explicit list of relations, and these are implied by certain generalized determinental identities that hold globally on $G$. 
However, these identities depend crucially on the fact that all minors involved are semi-invariants of the standard Borel subgroups and their conjugates. 
The minors arising from level zero representations do not have this property, so the relations that determine them cannot be deduced from these identities.


Instead, we study level zero minors in type $A_n^{(1)}$ by direct combinatorial means. The $LSL_n$ representations that appear are of the form $(\bigwedge^k\CC^n)[z^{\pm 1}]$\sayDR{Is it correct to say that we are studying certain subrepresentations of this one?}\sayHW{Ahh, before the order of operations was unclear, which I think was the basis of your questions -- is it ok with the parentheses now?}\sayDR{My confusion was actually different (but recognizing the difference between the two choices for parentheses is constructive), I forgot we can use the action of the entire group so any choice of $k$ strands generates the representation, wait is that true for this choice of parentheses?}, which inherits a natural basis from the standard basis of $\CC^n$. The restrictions to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ of the level zero minors appearing in (2) can be computed as a weighted sum over collections of paths through a directed network on the cylinder, as in [FM,GSV]. When $Q$ is an acyclic orientation of an $n$-cycle, its regular representations likewise have a simple combinatorial description, and one can construct by hand a bijection between their subrepresentations and collections of paths in the network.

%\begin{theorem}\label{thm:maintheorem}
%Let $G$ be an affine Lie group of type $A_n^{(1)}$, let $c$ be a Coxeter element of the affine Weyl group, and $Q_c$ the associated affine quiver.  The coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is an upper cluster algebras of type $Q_c$ and all mutable cluster variables are restrictions of principal minors for representations of $G$ with finite-dimensional weight spaces.  Those that are cluster characters of preprojective, regular, or postinjective representations of $Q_c$ are minors of positive level, level zero, and negative level $G$-representations, respectively.
%\end{theorem}

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:mainconjecture}
Let $Q$ be a finite quiver without oriented cycles and $G^{c,c^{-1}} \subset G$ the associated Coxeter double Bruhat cell. All regular cluster variables are generalized minors of representations that are neither highest- nor lowest-weight.
%The above theorem holds for arbitrary affine types.
\end{conjecture}

In addition to verifying the conjecture for all Coxeter elements when $G = LSL_n$, we check a finite list of other affine types, see Section \ref{sec:othertypes}. In any affine type, the regular cluster variables can be explicitly enumerated and computed. One can calculate that if they are restrictions of minors, they must come from an explicitly identifiable level zero representation. The types checked in Section \ref{sec:othertypes} are essentially the ones where these minors can be evaluated on $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ knowing only the character of this representation. In non-affine types, general weight representations of $G$ are not well-understood, and the conjecture is much more speculative.

Finally, in type $A_n^{(1)}$ the following suggestive extension of Theorem \ref{thm:maintheorem} also holds. There is a one-parameter family of quiver representations whose dimension vector is a primitive imaginary root. The cluster character of a generic element is not a cluster variable, but is an element of the generic bases, and presumably other standard bases. This element too is a level zero generalized minor; with this in mind it is natural to further ask which canonical basis elements other than cluster variables are generalized minors. \sayDR{In the $A_n^{(1)}$ case we should be able to compute the minors associated to multiples of $\delta$ (Salvatore and I played with this a little at MSRI) and get an apparently new basis for the cluster algebra, should we pursue this in the present paper?}\sayHW{Probably we should get out what we have, and leave the ``minor basis'' alone for now -- the paper is enough overdue that enlarging its scope requires extremely compelling justification, and even talking about the homogeneous element is pushing this}

%\section{Cluster Structures on Coxeter Double Bruhat Cells}
\section{Reminders on Acyclic Cluster Algebras}

\subsection{Cluster Algebras}

Given $m \geq n$, we say the principal part of an $m \times n$ matrix $B$ is the $n \times n$ submatrix formed by its first $n$ rows. We say an $m \times n$ matrix $B$ is skew-symmetrizable if there is a diagonal matrix $D$ such that the principal part of $DB$ is skew-symmetric. \sayHW{$DB$ or $BD$?}\sayDR{It should be $BD$ if you want to multiply the entire exchange matrix}
%We say an $m \times n$ integer matrix with $m > n$, and $D$ an $m \times m$ diagonal integer matrix such that $DB$ is skew-symmetric. 
We say two skew-symmetrizable $m \times n$ matrices $B$ and $B'$ are related by mutation at $k \in \{1,\dotsc,n\}$ if their entries are related by \sayHW{Make sure $[a]_+$ notation is properly introduced somewhere}\sayDR{We need either $\sgn(B_{ik})[B_{ik}B_{kj}]_+$ or $[B_{ik}]_+B_{kj}+B_{ik}[-B_{kj}]_+$, which is preferred?}
\[
B'_{ij} = \begin{cases}
-B_{ij} & i = k \text{ or } j = k\\
B_{ij} + [B_{ik}B_{kj}]_+ & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

We recall the definition of the cluster algebra $\cA_B$ associated to a skew-symmetrizable matrix $B$. 
Let $T$ be an infinite $n$-ary tree with edges labeled by $\{1,\dotsc,n\}$ so that the edges incident to any given vertex have distinct labels. 
Fix a root $t_0 \in T_0$, and assign a matrix $B^t$ to each $t \in T_0$ so that $B^{t_0} = B$, and if $t, t' \in T_0$ are joined by an edge labeled $k$, then $B^t$ and $B^{t'}$ are related by mutation at $k$.

Let $\cF$ denote the field of rational functions in formal variables $x_{1;t_0}\,\dotsc,x_{m;t_0}$ with coefficients in $\kk$. \sayHW{Fix earlier an alg. closed field $\kk$?} The cluster variables $\{ x_{i;t}; i \in \{1,\dotsc,m\}, t \in T_0\}$ are defined recursively from the initial cluster variables as follows. If $t,t' \in T_0$ are joined by an edge labeled $k$, then $x_{i;t} = x_{i;t'}$ for $i \neq k$, and $x_{k;t}$, $x_{k;t'}$ are related by the exchange relation 
\[
x_{k;t}x_{k;t'} = \prod_{B^t_{ik}>0}x_{i;t}^{B^t_{ik}} + \prod_{B^t_{ik}<0}x_{i;t}^{-B^t_{ik}}.
\]

\begin{definition}
The cluster algebra $\cA_B$ is the $\kk$-subalgebra of $\cF$ generated by the set of all cluster variables.
\end{definition}

The variables $x_{n+1;t},\dotsc, x_{m;t}$ do not depend on $t$ and are referred to as frozen variables. 

We associate a quiver $Q := Q_B$ to $B$ as follows: its vertices are indexed by $\{1,\dotsc,n\}$, and there are $[-(BD)_{ij}]_+$\sayDR{When $D$ is not the identity, it is usually $\gcd(B_{ij},B_{ji})$ arrows when $B_{ji}<0$} arrows from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.  We say $B$ is acyclic if $Q_B$ has no oriented cycles (this property does not depend on $D$). Conversely, given a finite quiver without oriented cycles, we have a skew-symmetric matrix $B$. 

When $B$ is acyclic, $\cA_B$ is finitely generated as a $\kk$-algebra and \sayHW{Check reference}\sayDR{It's correct.} coincides with the upper cluster algebra associated to $B$ [BFZ] (as such, we will not need to recall the latter notion explicitly).  

Each cluster variable $x_{i;t}$ is labeled by a distinct $g$-vector $g_{i;t}$ in $\ZZ^n$. These are determined by the following relations...


If $Q$ is a finite quiver without oriented cycles, the non-initial cluster variables in $\cA_Q$ are in bijection with the rigid indecomposable representations of $Q$ [CC, CK]. The bijection is given by associating to a representation $M$ a generating function encoding its submodule structure, referred to as its cluster character or Caldero-Chapoton function.

We write $\mathrm{coind}(M)$ for 


\[
x_M = x^{\mathrm{coind}(M)} \sum_{e \in \NN^n}\chi(\Gr_eM) \hat{y}^e
\]

This interpretation generalizes to the case of skew-symmetrizable matrices by replacing quiver representations with species representations. We refer to \cite{R15} for details, though we will not make direct use of this here.

The data of an acyclic skew-symmetrizable matrix $B$ is equivalent to the data of a root system together with a Coxeter element of its Weyl group. 

Let $G := G_B$ be the Kac-Moody group associated to this root system. The cluster algebra has the following geometric realization in terms of $G$:

\begin{proposition}\say[Group]{We need to think carefully about the change of coefficents, keeping in mind [Yang,Zelevinsky: p. 21] at the end of Sec. 4 and [Berenstein,Rupel: Lemma 6.8].}
The coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is an upper cluster algebra of type $B_c$ with doubled principal coefficients, that is, whose $3n \times n$ exchange matrix has principal part $B_c$ and frozen part two copies of the identity matrix.  The initial cluster variables are the principal minors $\Delta_{\omega_i}$.  The frozen variables are
\[
y_j = \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i})^{a_{ij}}, \quad z_j = \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i})^{a_{ij}}
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $B'$ be the $3n \times n$ exchange matrix with principal part $B_c$ and with $B'_{i+n,j} = B'_{i+2n,j} = [i = j] + a_{ij}[i < j]$ for $i,j \in [1,n]$.  Then the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is the upper cluster algebra with exchange matrix $B'$, initial cluster variables $\Delta_{\omega_i}^{\omega_i}$, and frozen variables $\Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i}$, $\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i}$ \cite{me}.  The proposition then follows from \Cref{prop:changeofcoeffs}
\end{proof}

\section{The acyclic belt in non-finite types}
In this section we present straightforward generalizations of some results from \cite[Sections 8-10]{FZ07} to the acyclic case.

Let $A$ be any irreducible Cartan matrix not of finite type and let $c=s_1\cdots s_n$ be a Coxeter element in the Weyl group of $A$.
The case when $A$ is of finite type is already covered in \cite{YZ08} and we will omit it here in order to simplify our notation.
\saySS{We can cover it if we use $w_0$ in place of $c^\infty$ to cover finite type. It is not clear to me that it is worth doing even though it will make life more uniform. Maybe we should add a comment here.}
In view of these assumptions any prefix of the word $c^\infty$ is reduced (cf. \cite{Spe09}).
Let $B_c$ be the skew-symmetrizable matrix associated to the pair $A,c$. 
\saySS{We should define $B_c$ somewhere in the introduction}
We will concern ourself with a specific sequence of seeds (the \emph{acyclic belt}) in the principal coefficients cluster algebra $\cAb(B_c)$.

More specifically, let $t_0$ be the node of the exchange graph containing the initial seed and $t_m$ the nodes given by the sequence
\begin{equation}
  \cdots
  \dashname{n}
  t_{-n}
  \dashname{1}
  \cdots
  \dashname{n-1}
  t_{-1}
  \dashname{n}
  t_0
  \dashname{1}
  t_1
  \dashname{2}
  \cdots
  \dashname{n}
  t_n
  \dashname{1}
  \cdots
\end{equation}
\saySS{We should probably comment on the fact that all these nodes of the exchange graph are distinct. It follows from the propositions we are about to prove but one might wonder whether the argument is circular here.}
\sayDR{I think the proposition below establishes this fact, I did not see any point where you assumed they were distinct in the proof.}
Following \cite{FZ02}, we denote by $\mod{m}$ the element of $[1,n]$ congruent to $m$ modulo $n$.
The edge immediately to the left of $t_m$ is then labeled by $\mod{m}$.
Observe that the nodes we are considering lie along a \emph{sink/source adapted sequence}. 
In particular, the entries of the exchange matrix $B_m$ at $t_m$ equal, in absolute value, the entries of $B_0$. 
Moreover the $\mod{m}$-th row of $B_m$ contains only non-positive entries and the $\mod{m+1}$-st row only non-negative entries.

We will interpret $\bfc$-vectors as coordinate vectors in the basis of simple roots for the root system of $A$ so that the $i$-th initial $\bfc$-vector is $\alpha_i$.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:c-vectors}
  Let $\gamma_{m,i}$ be the $i$-th $\bfc$-vector of $\cAb(B_c)$ in the seed at $t_m$. 
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    \gamma_{m,i}
    =
    \begin{cases}
      c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \alpha_i & \text{if $m>0$}\\
      \alpha_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and  $i\leq n+m$} \\
      -\alpha_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and $i>n+m$} \\
      -c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_i & \text{if $m <-n$}\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  Where, as usual, $\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor$ is the biggest integer smaller or equal to $x$ while $\left\lceil x \right\rceil$ is the smallest integer greater or equal to $x$.
  Moreover, whenever $m > 0 $ or $m < -n$, the vector $\gamma_{m,\mod{m}}$ is negative and the vector $\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}$ is positive.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
  If $m>0$ then $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}$ is the prefix of $c^\infty$ of length $m$.
  \saySS{Reminder: for $m>0$ we write $m=\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor n + \mod{m}$.}
  Similarly, if $m<-n$, $c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}}$ is the prefix of $c^{-\infty}$ of length $-m-n$.
  \saySS{Reminder: for $m<-n$ we write $-m-n =-\left(\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil+1\right)n+\mod{n-\mod{m}}$}
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  \saySS{I should remember to thank Anna and Pavel for hints on reflection groups}
  Let's begin by settling the claim about signs. 
  When $m>0$ the root $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \alpha_{\mod{m+1}}$ is positive: being a prefix of $c^\infty$, the word  $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} s_{\mod{m+1}}$ is reduced (cf. \cite{Spe09}) and we can apply \cite[VI \S 1.6 Corollary 2 to Proposition 17]{Bou02}.
  By the same principle the root $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \alpha_{\mod{m}} = -c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m-1}} \alpha_{\mod{m}}$ is negative because the word $c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}$ is reduced.
  Similarly, when $m<-n$ the root $-c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_{\mod{m+1}}$ is positive and the root $-c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_{\mod{m}}$ is negative.
  
  For the main claim there are three cases to consider.

  \noindent{\bf Case $-n \leq m \leq 0$.}
  We proceed by induction on $m$.
  For $m=0$ there is nothing to check.
  By construction, while the sign of $\gamma_{m,\mod{m}}$ is positive, the sign of the $\mod{m}$-th row of $B_m$ is negative. 
  The $\bfc$-vectors at $t_{m-1}$ are therefore given by:
  \begin{equation*}
    \gamma_{m-1,i}
    =
    \begin{cases}
      \gamma_{m,i} & \text{if $i\neq \mod{m}$}\\
      -\gamma_{m,\mod{m}} & \text{if $i = \mod{m}$}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  as desired.

  \noindent{\bf Case $m > 0$.}
  We again argue by induction on $m$ the base case still being $m=0$. 
  Since the sign of $\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}$ and the sign of the $\mod{m+1}$-st row of $B_m$ are both positive, in view of \cite[Proposition 1.3]{NZ12}, the $\bfc$-vectors at $t_{m+1}$ are given by
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma_{m+1,i} 
    &= 
    \gamma_{m,i} - a_{\mod{m+1},i} \gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}\\
    &=
    \gamma_{m,i} - \frac{2(\alpha_{\mod{m+1}},\alpha_i)}{(\alpha_{\mod{m+1}},\alpha_{\mod{m+1}})} \gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}\\
    &=
    \gamma_{m,i} - \frac{2(\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}},\gamma_{m,i})}{(\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}},\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}})} \gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}\\
    &=
    s_{\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}}\big(\gamma_{m,i}\big)
  \end{align*}
  where the second to last equality holds because the pairing $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is invariant under the action of the Weyl group.  
  Using the inductive hypotheses we can then conclude
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma_{m+1,i} 
    &=
    s_{\gamma_{m,\mod{m+1}}}\big(\gamma_{m,i}\big)\\
    &=
    \big(c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}\big)s_{\mod{m+1}}\big(s_{\mod{m}}\cdots s_1 c^{-\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}\big)\big(c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}\alpha_i\big)\\
    &= 
    c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}}s_{\mod{m+1}} \alpha_i.
  \end{align*}

  \noindent{\bf Case $m < -n$.}
  The argument is the same as the one used in the case $m>0$ with $m=-n$ as base for the induction. 
  The only minor change is that this time we leverage the fact that both the sign of $\gamma_{m,\mod{m}}$ and the sign of the $\mod{m}$-th row of $B_m$ are negative.
\end{proof}

In analogy to what we did for $\bfc$-vectors, we will interpret $\bfg$-vectors as coordinate vectors in the basis of fundamental weights for the root system of $A$ so that the $i$-th initial $\bfg$-vector is $\omega_i$.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:g-vectors}
  Let $\lambda_{m,i}$ be the $\bfg$-vector of the $i$-th cluster variable of $\cAb(B_c)$ in the seed at $t_m$. 
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    \lambda_{m,i}
    =
    \begin{cases}
      c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor}s_1\cdots s_{\mod{m}} \omega_i & \text{if $m>0$}\\
      \omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and  $i\leq n+m$} \\
      -\omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and $i>n+m$} \\
      -c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil}s_n\cdots s_{\mod{m+1}} \omega_i & \text{if $m <-n$}\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  In view of \Cref{prop:c-vectors} the $\bfc$-vectors of $\cAb(-B_c^T)$ at the seed $t_m$ are the coroots $\gamma_{m,i}^\vee$.
  The result follows then immediately from \cite[Theorem 1.2]{NZ12}: fundamental weights are the dual basis of the coroot basis and the pairing is invariant under the action of the Weyl group.
\end{proof}

In view of how simple reflections act on fundamental weights the expressions of the $\bfg$-vectors $\lambda_{m,i}$ can be expressed using only powers of $c$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{m,i}
  =
  \begin{cases}
    c^{\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor} \omega_i & \text{if $m>0$ and $i > \mod{m}$}\\
    c^{1+ \left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{n}\right\rfloor} \omega_i & \text{if $m>0$ and $i \leq \mod{m}$}\\
    \omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and  $i\leq n+m$} \\
    -\omega_i & \text{if $-n\leq m \leq 0$ and $i>n+m$} \\
    -c^{1+\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil} \omega_i & \text{if $m <-n$ and $i < \mod{m+1}$}\\
    -c^{\left\lceil\frac{m+1}{n}\right\rceil} \omega_i & \text{if $m <-n$ and $i \geq \mod{m+1}$}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
  \saySS{Note to self, check that the formulas are correct before publishing}
In particular, in the acyclic belt of $\cAb(B_c)$, there is one cluster variable $x_{c^k\omega_i}$ with  $\bfg$-vector $c^k\omega_i$ for any $k\geq 0$, and one cluster variable $x_{-c^{-k}\omega_i}$ with $\bfg$-vector $-c^{-k}\omega_i$ again for any $k\geq 0$.
Taking inspiration from quiver representation theory we will refer to the former as \emph{preprojective} cluster variables and to the latter as \emph{postinjective} cluster variables.
\saySS{I am not entirely happy with this definition: if I am not mistaken modules corresponding to initial cluster variables are neither preprojective not postinjective. Here we force them in the preprojective field to make it easier to state exchange relations later on. Would it make sense to drop the notation entirely? Do we need it anywhere?}
\sayDR{It is really only necessary if we wish to emphasize the similarity of trichotomies: (preprojective, regular, postinjecive) and (positive level, level zero, negative level).  As you correctly pointed out the initial cluster is a bit of an anomaly from the ``classical'' representation theory perspective, but the initial cluster variables do correspond to shifted projectives in the cluster category so the terminology might still be considered acceptable.}

\begin{corollary}
  The cluster variables in the acyclic belt of $\cAb(B_c)$ satisfy the following exchange relations $(k\geq 0)$:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    x_{c^k\omega_i}x_{c^{k+1}\omega_i} 
    &=& 
    \prod_{j<i} x_{c^{k+1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i} x_{c^k\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n y_j^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]}
    \\
    x_{-c^{-k}\omega_i}x_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_i} 
    &=& 
    \prod_{j<i} x_{-c^{-k}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i} x_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n y_j^{[c^{-k}\beta_i^-:\alpha_j]}
    \\
    x_{\omega_i}x_{-\omega_i}
    &=&
    y_i
    \prod_{j<i} x_{\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i} x_{-\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    1
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{corollary}
\saySS{We may want to substitute $s_1\dots s_{i-1}\alpha_i = \beta_i^+$ and $s_n\dots s_{i+1}\alpha_i = \beta_i^-$ to make things slightly clearer in the formulas (I am worried people might have issues in decoding the cases $i=1$ in the first and $i=n$ in the second.}
\begin{proof}
  Recall that $\beta_i^+=s_1\cdots s_{i-1}\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i^-=s_n\cdots s_{i+1}\alpha_i$. 
  The relations are an obvious consequence of \Cref{prop:c-vectors,prop:g-vectors} once we recall that mutations happen along a source/sink adapted sequence so that, at $t_m$, the $\mod{m}$-th colum of $B_m$ contains only non-negative entries and the $\mod{m+1}$-th column only non-positive entries. 
\end{proof}

\section{Highest and Lowest Weight Minors}

Throughout this section we fix a symmetrizable Kac-Moody group $G$ of infinite type and a Coxeter element $c$.  

\saySS{This should cover all the minors we care about; please correct me if I am mistaken}
Given $u,v\in W$ and $\lambda$ a weight, we denote by $\Delta_{u\lambda}^{v\lambda}$ the matrix coefficient 
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{u\lambda}^{v\lambda}(g) 
  := 
  \left(\left[ \overline{u}^{-1}g\overline{v} \right]_0\right)^\lambda
\end{equation}
When $u=v$ above, we will write $\Delta_{u\lambda}$ instead of $\Delta_{u\lambda}^{u\lambda}$.

\begin{proposition}\say[Group]{We need to think carefully about the change of coefficents, keeping in mind [Yang-Zelevinsky: p. 21] at the end of Sec. 4 and [Berenstein-Rupel: Lemma 6.8].}
The coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is an upper cluster algebra of type $B_c$ with doubled principal coefficients, that is, whose $3n \times n$ exchange matrix has principal part $B_c$ and frozen part two copies of the identity matrix.  The initial cluster variables are the principal minors $\Delta_{\omega_i}$.  The frozen variables are
\[
y_j = \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i})^{a_{ij}}, \quad z_j = \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i})^{a_{ij}}
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $B'$ be the $3n \times n$ exchange matrix with principal part $B_c$ and with $B'_{i+n,j} = B'_{i+2n,j} = [i = j] + a_{ij}[i < j]$ for $i,j \in [1,n]$.  Then the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is the upper cluster algebra with exchange matrix $B'$, initial cluster variables $\Delta_{\omega_i}^{\omega_i}$, and frozen variables $\Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i}$, $\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i}$ \cite{me}.  The proposition then follows from \Cref{prop:changeofcoeffs}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  %\label{prop:fundid}
Suppose $u, v \in W$, $k \in [1,n]$ satisfy $u s_k \omega_k < u \omega_k$ and $v s_k \omega_k < v \omega_k$.  Then the identity \sayHW{May make sense to just state on the derived subgroup, so we can ignore ``extended'' fundamental weights.}
\[
\Delta_{v \omega_k}^{u \omega_k}\Delta_{v s_k \omega_k}^{u s_k \omega_k} = 
\Delta_{v \omega_k}^{u s_k \omega_k}\Delta_{v s_k \omega_k}^{u \omega_k} + 
\prod_{i \neq k} (\Delta_{v\omega_i}^{u \omega_i})^{-a_{ik}}
\]
holds on $G$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 2.16]{Wil13}}]
  %\label{prop:fundid}
  \saySS{I am restating the previous proposition using the non derived version of $G$. Once we decide which theorem we are going to prove we should fix which $G$ do we care about.}
  Suppose $u,v \in W$ and $k\in[1,n]$ are such that $\ell(u)<\ell(us_k)$ and $\ell(v)<\ell(vs_k)$. 
  Then 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundid}
    \Delta_{u\omega_k}^{v\omega_k} \Delta_{us_k\omega_k}^{vs_k\omega_k} 
    =
    \Delta_{us_k\omega_k}^{v\omega_k} \Delta_{u\omega_k}^{vs_k\omega_k}
    +
    \prod_{\stackrel{1\leq i \leq \tilde{n}}{i\neq k}}\left(\Delta_{u\omega_i}^{v\omega_i}\right)^{-a_{ik}}
    .
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}

From \Cref{prop:fundid} we deduce two identities valid on $G$.
Set $u=v=c^ms_1\cdots s_{k-1}$. 
Then
\begin{align}
  \Delta_{c^m\omega_k} \Delta_{c^{m+1}\omega_k} 
  &=\Delta_{c^{m+1}\omega_k}^{c^m\omega_k} \Delta_{c^m\omega_k}^{c^{m+1}\omega_k}\\
  \nonumber &\quad+\prod_{1\leq i<k}\left(\Delta_{c^{m+1}\omega_i}\right)^{-a_{ik}}
  \prod_{k<i\leq n}\left(\Delta_{c^m\omega_i}\right)^{-a_{ik}}
  \prod_{n<i\leq\tilde{n}}\left(\Delta_{\omega_i}\right)^{-a_{ik}}
  .
\end{align}
Recall that (cf. \cite[(3.6)]{YZ}) $G$ is equipped with an anti-involutive automorphism $\iota$ defined by
\begin{equation}
  a^\iota = a^{-1} \quad (a\in H)
  \quad\quad
  x_i(t)^\iota=x_i(t)
  \quad\quad
  x_{\overline{i}}(t)^\iota=x_{\overline{i}}(t)
  .
\end{equation}
Note that 
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{u\lambda}^{v\lambda}(x) 
  =
  \Delta_{-v\lambda}^{-u\lambda}(x^\iota)
\end{equation}
Substituting $u=v=c^{-m}s_n\cdots s_{k+1}$ in \Cref{eq:fundid} and evaluating at $x^\iota$ we get
\begin{align}
  \Delta_{-c^{-m}\omega_k} \Delta_{-c^{-m-1}\omega_k}
  &=\Delta_{-c^{-m}\omega_k}^{-c^{-m-1}\omega_k} \Delta_{-c^{-m-1}\omega_k}^{-c^{-m}\omega_k}\\
  \nonumber &\quad+\prod_{1\leq i<k}\left(\Delta_{-c^{-m}\omega_i}\right)^{-a_{ik}}
  \prod_{k<i\leq n}\left(\Delta_{-c^{-m-1}\omega_i}\right)^{-a_{ik}}
  \prod_{n<i\leq\tilde{n}}\left(\Delta_{-\omega_i}\right)^{-a_{ik}}.
\end{align}

For any root $\alpha$ we define $[\alpha:\alpha_i]$ by $\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n [\alpha:\alpha_i]\alpha_i$, defining $[\alpha:\beta_k^+]$ analogously.

  \begin{lemma}\label{lem:minorsondbc}
    Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$, the product $\Delta_{c^{m-1}\omega_k}\Delta_{c^{m}\omega_k}$ is equal to
    \begin{equation} 
      \prod_{j=1}^n \left( \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j}\Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}\big(\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i} \Delta^{\omega_i}_{c \omega_i}\big)^{a_{ij}}\right)^{[c^{m-1} \beta_k^+:\alpha_j]} + 
      \left(\prod_{i < k}\big(\Delta_{c^{m}\omega_i}\big)^{-a_{ik}}\right)\left(\prod_{i>k}\big(\Delta_{c^{m-1}\omega_i}\big)^{-a_{ik}}\right)
    \end{equation}
    for any $k \in [1,n]$, $m \geq 1$.  
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    We apply \Cref{prop:fundid} with $u = v = c^{m-1}s_1 \cdots s_{k-1}$ and compare with the given expression.  Notice that the final monomials in these expressions are exactly identified.  It only remains to understand the monomial $\Delta_{c^m \omega_k}^{c^{m-1} \omega_k}\Delta_{c^{m-1} \omega_k}^{c^m \omega_k}$ from \Cref{prop:fundid}.

    We first claim that upon restriction to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ we have
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:coeffreduction}
      \Delta_{c^m \omega_k}^{c^{m-1} \omega_k} = 
      \prod_{i=1}^n (\Delta_{c \omega_i}^{\omega_i})^{[c^{m-1}\beta_k^+:\beta_i^+]}.
    \end{equation}
    To see this, it suffices to evaluate both sides on a generic $g \in G^{c,c^{-1}}$ of the form
    \[
      g = hx_{-1}(t_{-1}) \cdots x_{-n}(t_{-n}) x_{n}(t_{n}) \cdots x_{1}(t_{1})
    \]
    for $h \in H$ and $t_i \in \CC^*$.  Since $(s_1 \cdots s_n)^m$ is a reduced expression of $c^m$ for any $m \geq 1$ (cf. \cite{Spe09}), a straightforward calculation with root strings in the highest weight representation $L_{\omega_k}$ yields
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:coeffeval}
      \Delta_{c^m \omega_k}^{c^{m-1}\omega_k}(g) = h^{c^{m-1}\omega_k} \prod_{j=1}^n t_j^{[c^{m-1}\beta_k^+:\alpha_j]}.
    \end{equation}
    
    The case $m=1$ of eq. \eqref{eq:coeffreduction} is immediate.  To reduce the general case to this one we will need to rewrite eq. \eqref{eq:coeffeval} using the equality
    \[
      c^{m-1} \omega_k = \sum_{i=1}^n [c^{m-1}\beta_k^+:\beta_i^+]\omega_i.
    \]
    To see this, first notice that the $\beta_i^+$ are linearly independent since they are obtained from the $\alpha_i$ by a unitriangular transformation.  Thus $1-c$ is an isomorphism from the subspace spanned by the $\omega_i$ to that spanned by the $\beta_i^+$, and the identity follows since $1-c$ commutes with $c^{m-1}$.  

    Now applying the identity
    \[
      [\alpha:\alpha_j] = \sum_{i=1}^n [\alpha:\beta_i^+][\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]
    \]
    with $\alpha=c^{m-1}\beta_k^+$ in the final exponent of eq. \eqref{eq:coeffeval},
    we may rewrite \Cref{eq:coeffeval} with $i = k$ and arbitrary $m$ in terms of the $m = 1$, arbitrary $i$ case and obtain \Cref{eq:coeffreduction}.

    Since $\beta_j^+ + \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} a_{ij} \beta_i^+ = \alpha_j$, we can further rewrite \Cref{eq:coeffreduction} as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:coeffident}
      \Delta_{c^m \omega_k}^{c^{m-1} \omega_k} = 
      \prod_{j=1}^n \left( \Delta_{c \omega_j}^{\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta_{c \omega_i}^{\omega_i})^{a_{ij}}\right)^{[c^{m-1} \beta_k^+:\alpha_j]}. 
    \end{equation}
    On the other hand, consider the anti-automorphism of $G$ which fixes $H$ and exchanges $x_i(t)$ with $x_{-i}(t)$.  This takes $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ to itself and pulls back $\Delta_{\omega}^{\lambda}$ to $\Delta^{\omega}_{\lambda}$.  Applying this anti-automorphism to \Cref{eq:coeffident} we obtain
    \[
      \Delta^{c^m \omega_k}_{c^{m-1} \omega_k} = 
      \prod_{j=1}^n \left( \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j} \prod_{i < j}(\Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i})^{a_{ij}}\right)^{[c^{m-1} \beta_k^+:\alpha_j]}.
    \]
    This completes the proof.

\saySS{From this point to the end of the section is some refactoring that will replace the above part. I am mostly tying to uniformize notation across the board}
\saySS{Add a sentence stating that we work in the derived version of $G$}
\saySS{Add a sentence to say that we borrow/adapt most of the proofs from \cite{YZ08}}

We begin by recalling some known identities and giving explicit expressions for the value of certain minors on the generic point of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ that will be used in the subsequent proofs.

For $i\in[1,n]$ let $\varphi_i:SL_2\rightarrow G$ denote the canonical embedding corresponding to the simple root $\alpha_i$. 
For $t\in\CC$ write 
\begin{equation}
  x_{-i}(t):=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ t & 1\end{array}\right)
  \quad
  \quad
  x_i(t):=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & t \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
and for $t \in \CC^\times$
\begin{equation}
  t^{\alpha_i^\vee}:=\varphi_i\left(\begin{array}{cc}t & 0 \\ 0 & t^{-1}\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
so that the generic element of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:generic_element}
  g=x_{-1}(t_{-1}) \cdots x_{-n}(t_{-n}) h x_n(t_n) \cdots x_1(t_1)
\end{equation}
with $h\in H$ and $t_{\pm i} \in \CC$ (cf. \cite[Proposition 3.2]{Wil13} were we prefer to place the torus part in central position using the classical commutation relations \cite[(2.5)]{FZ99}).

Let $\iota$ be the anti-automorphism of $G$ defined by
\begin{equation}
  h^\iota := h^{-1}\,\, (h\in H),
  \quad
  \quad
  x_i(t)^\iota := x_i(t),
  \quad
  \quad
  x_{-i}(t)^\iota := x_{-i}(t).
\end{equation}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:iota_iso}
  \saySS{This lemma is true-ish as in this is not an isomorphism; what is the right wording here?}
  $\iota$ restrict to an isomorphism of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ with $G^{c^{-1},c}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \saySS{This is kind of obvious so we might consider getting rid of the proof}
  It suffices to verify this on the generic element $g$ of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ written as in \Cref{eq:generic_element}.
  We have 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    g^\iota &=& \big(x_{-1}(t_{-1}) \cdots x_{-n}(t_{-n}) h x_n(t_n) \cdots x_1(t_1)\big)^\iota\\
    &=& x_1(t_1)^\iota \cdots x_n(t_n)^\iota h^\iota x_{-n}(t_{-n})^\iota \cdots x_{-1}(t_{-1})^\iota\\
    &=& x_1(t_1) \cdots x_n(t_n) h^{-1} x_{-n}(t_{-n}) \cdots x_{-1}(t_{-1})
  \end{eqnarray*}
  which is the generic element of $G^{c^{-1},c}$ by \cite[Proposition 3.2]{Wil13}.
\end{proof}

We will deduce some of the desired identities from the following fundamental one.
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 2.16]{Wil13}}]
  \label{prop:fundid}
  Suppose $u,v \in W$ and $i\in[1,n]$ are such that $\ell(u)<\ell(us_i)$ and $\ell(v)<\ell(vs_i)$. 
  Then 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fundid}
    \Delta_{u\omega_i}^{v\omega_i} \Delta_{us_i\omega_i}^{vs_i\omega_i} 
    =
    \prod_{\stackrel{1\leq j \leq n}{j\neq i}}\left(\Delta_{u\omega_j}^{v\omega_j}\right)^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \Delta_{us_i\omega_i}^{v\omega_i} \Delta_{u\omega_i}^{vs_i\omega_i}
    .
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:coefficient_computations}
  On the generic element $g$ of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ expressed as in \Cref{eq:generic_element} the following can be computed explicitly:
  \saySS{We may have to make these more general allowing other powers of $c$ as in the proof of the preprojective identity; if we do add a comment in the proof saying that $c^m$ is reduced.}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta^{c\omega_j}_{\omega_j}(g) &=& h^{\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{-i}^{[\beta_j^+:\alpha_i]}\\
    \Delta^{\omega_j}_{c\omega_j}(g) &=& h^{\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[\beta_j^+:\alpha_i]}\\
    \Delta^{-c^{-1}\omega_j}_{-\omega_j}(g) &=& h^{-c^{-1}\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[\beta_j^-:\alpha_i]}\\
    \Delta^{-\omega_j}_{-c^{-1}\omega_j}(g) &=& h^{-c^{-1}\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{-i}^{[\beta_j^-:\alpha_i]}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first two identities are a straightforward calculation with root strings in the highest weight representation $L_{\omega_k}$; the remaining two are a similar computation in $L_{-\omega_k}$.
  \saySS{We may want to say much more on this (Cf. \cite[Proof of eq. 3.20]{YZ08}) but we are already writing a lot of computations enough to disgust even the more coscentious reader.}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ the following two identities holds:
  \label{lemma:coefficients_identities}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta_{c\omega_j}^{\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell<j}\big(\Delta_{c\omega_\ell}^{\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    &=&
    \Delta_{-\omega_j}^{-c^{-1}\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell>j}\big(\Delta_{-\omega_\ell}^{-c^{-1}\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}\\
    \Delta_{\omega_j}^{c\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell<j}\big(\Delta_{\omega_\ell}^{c\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    &=&
    \Delta_{-c^{-1}\omega_j}^{-\omega_j}
    \prod_{\ell>j}\big(\Delta_{-c^{-1}\omega_\ell}^{-\omega_\ell}\big)^{a_{\ell j}}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We will show only the first one the other being obtained in a similar fashon.
  Evaluating both sides at the generic element $g$ of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ expressed as in \Cref{eq:generic_element}, and using \Cref{lemma:coefficient_computations} the identity to prove becomes
  \[
    \left(h^{\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[\beta_j^+:\alpha_i]}\right)
    \prod_{\ell<j}\left(h^{\omega_\ell}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[\beta_\ell^+:\alpha_i]}\right)^{a_{\ell j}}
    =
    \left(h^{-c^{-1}\omega_j}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[\beta_j^-:\alpha_i]}\right)
    \prod_{\ell>j}\left(h^{-c^{-1}\omega_\ell}\prod_{i=1}^n t_{i}^{[\beta_\ell^-:\alpha_i]}\right)^{a_{\ell j}}
  \]
  which holds if the following two identities are both satisfied:
  \begin{equation}
    \omega_j + \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
    =
    -c^{-1}\left(\omega_j + \sum_{\ell>j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell\right)
  \end{equation}
  and, for every $i\in[1,n]$,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:identity_betas}
    [\beta_j^+:\alpha_i]+\sum_{\ell<j}a_{\ell j}[\beta_\ell^+:\alpha_i]
    =
    [\beta_j^-:\alpha_i]+\sum_{\ell>j}a_{\ell j}[\beta_\ell^-:\alpha_i].
  \end{equation}

  We begin by the former. 
  Mupliplying both sides by $s_{j+1}\cdots s_n$ we want to show that
  \[
    s_{j+1}\cdots s_n\left(\omega_j + \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell\right)=
    -s_js_{j-1}\cdots s_1\left(\omega_j + \sum_{\ell>j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell\right).
  \]
  Since $s_i\omega_j=\omega_j$ for $i\neq j$, this is equivalent to
  \[
    \omega_j + \sum_{\ell<j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
    =
    -s_j\omega_j-\sum_{\ell>j} a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
  \]
  i.e. 
  \begin{equation}
    s_j\omega_j
    =
    -\omega_j-\sum_{\ell\neq j}a_{\ell j}\omega_\ell
  \end{equation}
  which is the definition of $s_j\omega_j$.

  We turn now to \Cref{eq:identity_betas}.
  Summing over $i$ we can restate it as
  \begin{equation}
    \beta_j^++\sum_{\ell<j}a_{\ell j}\beta_\ell^+
    =
    \beta_j^-+\sum_{\ell>j}a_{\ell j}\beta_\ell^-
  \end{equation}
  and both sides are equal to $\alpha_j$ by telescoping.
\end{proof}

From the proof \Cref{lemma:coefficients_identities} we get immediately the following:
\begin{corollary}
  \label{corollary:coefficients_values}
  \saySS{Scholium?}
  On the generic element \Cref{eq:generic_element} of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ we can explicitly compute
  \begin{eqnarray}
    y_i=
    \Delta_{c\omega_i}^{\omega_i}
    \prod_{ j <i}\big(\Delta_{c\omega_ j }^{\omega_ j }\big)^{a_{ j  i}}
    &=&
    t_i
    h^{\omega_i}\prod_{ j <i}h^{a_{ j  i}\omega_ j }\\
    z_i=
    \Delta_{\omega_i}^{c\omega_i}
    \prod_{ j <i}\big(\Delta_{\omega_ j }^{c\omega_ j }\big)^{a_{ j  i}}
    &=&
    t_{-i}
    h^{\omega_i}\prod_{ j <i}h^{a_{ j  i}\omega_ j }
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{corollary}

We are finally ready to prove the three identities we are after.

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:projective_minors_identity}
  Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$, for any $k\geq 0$ and $i\in[1,n]$, the product $\Delta_{c^k\omega_i}\Delta_{c^{k+1}\omega_i}$ is equal to
  \begin{equation} 
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{c^{k+1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{c^k\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
      \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j}
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} 
      \prod_{\ell<j}\big(
        \Delta^{c \omega_\ell}_{\omega_\ell} 
        \Delta^{\omega_\ell}_{c \omega_\ell}
      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    \right)^{[c^k\beta_i^+:\alpha_j]}
  \end{equation}
  where all the running indices in the products are in $[1,n]$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
  Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$, for any $k\geq 0$ and $i\in[1,n]$, the product $\Delta_{-c^{-k}\omega_i}\Delta_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_i}$ is equal to
  \begin{equation} 
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{-c^{-k}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
      \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j}
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c\omega_j} 
      \prod_{\ell<j}\big(
        \Delta^{c \omega_\ell}_{\omega_\ell} 
        \Delta^{\omega_\ell}_{c \omega_\ell}
      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    \right)^{[c^{-k}\beta_i^-:\alpha_j]}
  \end{equation}
  where all the running indices in the products are in $[1,n]$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Restricted to the ``inverse'' double Bruhat cell $G^{c^{-1},c}$ \Cref{prop:projective_minors_identity} says that $\Delta_{c^{-k}\omega_i} \Delta_{c^{-k-1}\omega_i}$ equals
  \[
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{c^{-k}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{c^{-k-1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
      \Delta^{c^{-1} \omega_j}_{\omega_j}
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{ c^{-1}\omega_j} 
      \prod_{\ell>j}\big(
        \Delta^{c^{-1} \omega_\ell}_{\omega_\ell} 
        \Delta^{\omega_\ell}_{c^{-1} \omega_\ell}
      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    \right)^{[c^{-k}\beta_i^-:\alpha_j]}
  \]
  Recalling that $\Delta_\lambda^\mu(g)=\Delta_{-\mu}^{-\lambda}(g^\iota)$ (\cite[(2.25)]{FZ99}) and that $\iota$ maps $G^{c^{-1},c}$ to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ (\Cref{lemma:iota_iso}), we get that $\Delta_{-c^{-k}\omega_i} \Delta_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_i}$ equals
  \[
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{-c^{-k}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{-c^{-k-1}\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    \prod_{j=1}^n\left( 
      \Delta^{-\omega_j}_{-c^{-1}\omega_j} 
      \Delta^{-c^{-1} \omega_j}_{-\omega_j}
      \prod_{\ell>j}\big(
        \Delta^{-\omega_\ell}_{-c^{-1}\omega_\ell}
        \Delta^{-c^{-1} \omega_\ell}_{-\omega_\ell} 
      \big)^{a_{\ell j}}
    \right)^{[c^{-k}\beta_i^-:\alpha_j]}
  \]
  in $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ and the results follows from \Cref{lemma:coefficients_identities}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  Restricted to $G^{c,c^{-1}}$, for any $i\in[1,n]$, the product $\Delta_{\omega_i}\Delta_{-\omega_i}$ is equal to
  \begin{equation} 
    \Delta^{c \omega_i}_{\omega_i}
    \Delta^{\omega_i}_{ c\omega_i} 
    \prod_{j<i}\big(
      \Delta^{c \omega_j}_{\omega_j} 
      \Delta^{\omega_j}_{c \omega_j}
    \big)^{a_{j i}}
    \prod_{j<i}\Delta_{\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{-\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}
    +1
  \end{equation}
  where all the running indices in the products are in $[1,n]$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  In view of \Cref{corollary:coefficients_values} and remebering that on the generic element \Cref{eq:generic_element} of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ 
  \[
    \Delta_{\omega_i}(g) = h^{\omega_i}
  \]
  the identity to prove becomes
  \[
    h^{\omega_i}\Delta_{-\omega_i}(g)
    =
    t_i
    t_{-i}
    h^{2\omega_i}
    \prod_{j<i}h^{a_{j i}\omega_j}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{-\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}(g)
    +
    1.
  \]
  Equivalently, applying $\iota$, we need to show that 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    h^{\omega_i}\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)
    & = &
    t_i
    t_{-i}
    h^{2\omega_i}
    \prod_{j<i}h^{a_{ji}\omega_j}
    \prod_{j>i}\Delta_{\omega_j}^{-a_{ji}}(g^\iota)
    +
    1\\
    & = &
    t_i
    t_{-i}
    h^{\alpha_i}
    \prod_{j>i}\Big(h^{\omega_j}\Delta_{\omega_j}(g^\iota)\Big)^{-a_{ji}}
    +
    1
  \end{eqnarray*}

  To compute $\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)$ we need to straighten up the expression of $g^\iota$ using the commutations relations (Cf. \cite[Proposition 7.2]{BZ01})
  \begin{equation}
    x_i(t_i)x_{-j}(t_{-j}) 
    =
    x_{-j}(t_{-j})x_i(t_i) 
    \qquad
    \qquad
    (\text{if $i\neq j$})
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    x_i(t_i) h x_{-i}(t_{-i})
    =
    x_{-i}(t'_{-i})
    h
    (1+t_it_{-i}h^{-\alpha_i})^{\alpha_i^\vee}
    x_{i}(t'_i)
  \end{equation}
  where the precise values of the non-zero complex numbers $t'_i$ and $t'_{-i}$ is irrelevant to our computation.
  Iterating these it is straightforward to see that
  \[
    g^\iota 
    = 
    x_{-n}(t'_{-n})
    \cdots
    x_{-1}(t'_{-1})
    h^{-1}
    v_1^{\alpha^\vee_1}
    \dots
    v_n^{\alpha^\vee_n}
    x_1(t'_1)
    \dots
    x_n(t'_n)
  \]
  where the non-zero complex numbers $v_i$ satisfy the recurrence relation
  \[
    v_i 
    = 
    1 + t_i t_{-i} h^{\alpha_i}
    \prod_{j > i} v_j^{-a_{j,i}}.
  \]

  To conclude our proof is then sufficient to observe that $h^{\omega_i}\Delta_{\omega_i}(g^\iota)$ is $v_i$.

\end{proof}

\section{Level Zero Representations}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:level zero}
Let $G = \widehat{LSL_{n+1}}$ be the affine Kac-Moody group of type $A_n^{(1)}$, let $c$ be a Coxeter element of the affine Weyl group, and $Q_c$ the associated affine quiver.  All regular cluster variables in the coordinate ring of $G^{c,c^{-1}}$ are principal minors of level zero representations.  
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a regular representation $M_{[p,q]}$ compute the strand configuration whose minor has the same $F$-polynomial.
\item Show that the injective copresentation matches the weight of the minor.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Networks}

We will study generalized minors by modeling them with weighted networks on a cylinder. A graph is weighted if all of its edges are assigned elements of a fixed ring; below this will be the Laurent polynomial ring $\CC[t_{\pm0}^{\pm1},\dotsc,t_{\pm n}^{\pm1},h_0^{\pm1},\dotsc,h_n^{\pm1}]$ with $3n+3$ polynomial generators.

\begin{definition}
Given $c = s_{\sigma_0} \dotsc s_{\sigma_n}$, define the \emph{network} $\cN_c$ to be the following weighted directed graph on the cylinder. We describe it as the concatenation of subgraphs on cyclinders associated to the factors in the decomposition 
\[g=x_{-\sigma_0}(t_{-\sigma_0})\cdots x_{-\sigma_n}(t_{-\sigma_n}) hx_{\sigma_n}(t_{\sigma_n}) \cdots x_{\sigma_0}(t_{\sigma_0}),\]
where $h$ factors as $\prod\limits_{i=0}^n h_i$ with $h_i=\big(h^{\omega_i}\big)^{\alpha_i^\vee}$.  Note that $h_i^{\omega_i}=h^{\omega_i}$ and $h_i^{\omega_j}=1$ for $i\ne j$.  We will abuse notation slightly and write $h_i$ also for the value $h_i^{\omega_i}$.

Each subcylinder has $n+1$ non-crossing \emph{horizontal} edges running from one boundary component to the other which are oriented from right to left and labeled by $\ZZ_{n+1}$ compatibly with their cyclic ordering.  The subcylinder associated to $x_{\pm i}(t_{\pm i})$ contains a (\emph{vertical}) \emph{bridge} with weight $t_{\pm i}$ joining the $(i-1)^{st}$ horizontal edge and the $i^{th}$ horizontal edge, this bridge is oriented upward for $i$ and downward for $-i$.  In the subcylinder associated to $h_i$, the $i^{th}$ edge has weight $h_i^{-1}$ and the $(i-1)^{st}$ edge has weight $h_i$.  All other edges in a subcylinder are taken to have weight 1.

 \erase{The vertical edge in the subcylinder associated to $x_{\overline{i}\,}(u_i)$ runs from the $(i - 1)^{st}$ horizontal edge to the $i^{th}$ horizontal edge. It and all horizontal edges other than the two it connects have weight $1$. The part of the $i^{th}$ edge before it meets the vertical edge has weight $u_i$, the part after has weight $1$.  The part of the $(\sigma_i-1)$st edge before it meets the vertical edge has weight $1$, the part after has weight $u_{\sigma_i}^{-1}$.\sayHW{This is correct if we are using $L^{c,c^{-1}}$, would need change for $G^{c,c^{-1}}$}}

By a path in $\cN_c$ we will mean a path which is directed compatibly with the edges of $\cN_c$, and which begins at a source on one end of the cyclinder and ends at a sink on the other end. 
If $P = \{P_i\}$ is a collection of paths, we write $\partial_{in}P \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ for the set of boundary sources at which paths in $P$ begin; similarly $\partial_{out}P \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ denotes the set of boundary sinks. 
We say the weight of a path is the product of the weights of edges it traverses, and the weight $wt(P)$ of a collection of paths is the product of the weights of its constituent paths.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:minorsfrompaths}
Given $S \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$, let
\[ \omega_S = \sum_{i \in S} \omega_{i+1} - \omega_i.\] 
Then for generic $g\in G^{c,c^{-1}}$ we have \[ \Delta_{\omega_S}(g) = \sum_{P: S \to S} wt(P), \]
where the sum is over collections $P$ of pairwise disjoint paths with $\partial_{in}P = \partial_{out}P = S$.
%$|S|$-tuples of non-intersecting paths in $\cN_c$ with input and output sets equal to $S$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By construction, the directed graph $\cN_c$ encodes the action of $g$ in the standard basis $\{ e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_k} z^\ell\}$ of $\bigwedge^k \CC^n[z^{\pm 1}]$. 
This basis is labeled by pairs of a $k$-element subset of $\ZZ_{n+1}$ and an integer $\ell$.
\end{proof}

To use the above proposition effectively, we collect some elementary combinatorial observations about non-crossing paths $P$ in $\cN_c$. 
We define $\phi(P) \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ by letting $j \in \phi(P)$ if and only if a path in $P$ traverses the unique bridge of weight $t_j$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:phi}
  Let $P$ be a collection of pairwise disjoint paths in $\cN_c$.  Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $i\in\partial_{in}P$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item if $i\to i+1$ in $Q$ or $i\notin\phi(P)$, then $i+1\notin\phi(P)$;
      \item if $i\leftarrow i+1$ in $Q$ and $i+1\in\phi(P)$, then $i\in\phi(P)$;
      \item[(b')] if  $i+1\in\phi(P)$, then $i\in\phi(P)$ and $i+1\to i$ in $Q$;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item For $i\notin\partial_{in}P$: if $i\to i+1$ in $Q$ and $i\in\phi(P)$, then $i+1\in\phi(P)$.\\
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $i \to i+1$ in $Q$, $i \in \phi(P)$, and $i \notin \partial_{in}(P)$, then $i + 1 \in \phi(P)$.
    \item If $i \to i+1$ in $Q$ and $i \in \partial_{in}P$, then $i +1 \notin \phi(P)$.
    \item If $i+1 \to i$ in $Q$, $i \in \partial_{in}P$, and $i+1 \in \phi(P)$, then $i \in \phi(P)$.
    \item If $i \notin \phi(P)$ and $i \in \partial_{in}P$, then $i +1 \notin \phi(P)$.

Recall that the regular cluster variables are labeled by intervals $[p,q] \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ containing as many sources as sinks -- to such an interval we associate a boundary condition on paths in $\cN_c$:

\begin{definition}\label{def:Spq}
Let $[p,q] \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ be an interval containing an even number of sinks and sources; that is, such that $M_{[p,q]}$ is regular. Write $k_1 < \cdots < k_m$ (resp. $c_1 < \cdots < c_m$) for the indices of the sinks (resp. sources) in $[p,q]$. Let $S_{[p,q]}$ denote the following subset of $\ZZ_{n+1}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the first sink in $[p,q]$ comes before the first source (i.e. $k_1 < c_1$ in $[p,q]$), then 
\[
S_{[p,q]} = [q,p-2] \cup [k_1, c_1 -1] \cup \cdots \cup [k_m, c_m - 1].
\]
\item If the first source in $[p,q]$ comes before the first sink (i.e. $c_1 < k_1$ in $[p,q]$),
\[
S_{[p,q]} = [p,c_1-1] \cup [k_1,c_2-1] \cup \cdots \cup [k_m,q].
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The above definition is determined by the following property:
\begin{proposition}
Let 
\[
M_{[p,q]} \to \bigoplus I_j^{a_j} \to \bigoplus I_j^{b_j}
\]
be the minimal injective resolution of $M_{[p,q]}$. Then
\[
\sum_j (b_j - a_j)\omega_j = \sum_{i \in S_{[p,q]}} \omega_{i+1} - \omega_i.
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
As in Definition \ref{def:Spq}, we let $k_1 < \cdots < k_m$, $c_1 < \cdots < c_m$ be the labels of the sinks and sources in $[p,q]$. If $k_1 < c_1$ in $[p,q]$, then the minimal injective resolution of $M_{[p,q]}$ is
\[
M_{[p,q]} \to I_q \oplus I_{k_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus I_{k_m} \to I_{p-1} \oplus I_{c_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus I_{c_m}.
\]
\end{proof}

We now turn to the main result of the section:

\begin{theorem}\sayDR{Merge this into Prop.~\ref{prop:level zero} and move the proof into the following section.}
If $M_{[p,q]}$ is regular, then under the isomorphism $\CC[G^{c,c^{-1}}] \cong A_Q$ we have
\[ x_{M_{[p,q]}} = \Delta_{\omega_{S_{[p,q]}}}\]  
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\cP = \{P: S_{[p,q]} \to S_{[p,q]}\}$ denote the set of pairwise disjoint collections of paths in $\cN_c$ with $\partial_{in}P = \partial_{out}P = S_{[p,q]}$. 
By Proposition \ref{prop:minorsfrompaths}, for a generic element 
\[g = x_{-\sigma_0}(t_{-\sigma_0})\cdots x_{-\sigma_n}(t_{-\sigma_n}) hx_{\sigma_n}(t_{\sigma_n}) \cdots x_{\sigma_0}(t_{\sigma_0})\]
the evaluation $\Delta_{\omega_{S_{[p,q]}}}(g)$ is the weighted sum 
\[
\Delta_{\omega_{S_{[p,q]}}}(g) = \sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}} wt(P).
\]
As in Theorem~\ref{???}, let $\cE = \{ E \subset [p,q]\}$ denote the subsets of $E \subset [p,q]$ that are target-closed: if there is an arrow $i \to j$ in $Q$ and $i, j$ are in $[p,q]$, then $E$ must contain $j$ if it contains $i$. 
% $i \in E$, $j \in [p,q]$, and there is an arrow from $i$ to $j$ in $Q$, then $j \in E$. 
Then we have 
\[
x_{M_{[p,q]}} = x^g \sum_{E \in \cE} \prod_{i \in E} \hat{y}_i.
\]\sayDR{Using $g$ here for the $g$-vector is an abuse of notation.}

As in Lemma \ref{lem:phi}, we define $\phi(P) \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ by letting $j \in \phi(P)$ if and only if a path in $P$ traverses the unique edge of weight $t_j$. We claim that for $P \in \cP$, $\phi(P)$ is in fact a subset of $[p,q]$, is target-closed in $[p,q]$, and that the assignment $P \mapsto \phi(P)$ defines a bijection $\cP \cong \cE$.

%Recall that $\cN_c$ consists of parallel strands labeled by $\Z_{n+1}$ connecting the two boundary components of the cylinder, and two sets of $n+1$ vertical strands connecting them. One of those sets has edges weighted $t_j$, and with 

%Recall that for $P \in \cP$ and any $j \in \Z_{n+1}$, $wt(P)$ either does not depend on $t_j$ or is linear in $t_j$. 

%Let $\phi(P) \subset \ZZ_{n+1}$ denote the set of indices $j$ such that $wt(P)$ depends non-trivially on $t_j$. Recall that $t_j$ appears as the weight of a unique edge in $\cN_c$, so equivalently $\phi(P)$ records which of these edges are traversed by a path in $P$. We claim that $\phi(P)$ is in fact a subset of $[p,q]$, is target-closed in $[p,q]$, and that the assignment $P \mapsto \phi(P)$ defines a bijection $\cP \cong \cE$.

As in Definition \ref{def:Spq}, we let $k_1 < \cdots < k_m$, $c_1 < \cdots < c_m$ denote the labels of the sinks and sources in $[p,q]$. We first consider the case where the first sink in $[p,q]$ comes before the first source (i.e. $k_1 < c_1$ in $[p,q]$). Recall that in this case
\[
S_{[p,q]} = [q,p-2] \cup [k_1, c_1 -1] \cup \cdots \cup [k_m, c_m - 1].
\]

Let $P \in \cP$. By assumption we have $q \to q+1$ in $Q$; $q \in \partial_{in}P$ then implies $q+1 \notin \phi(P)$ by item (3) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi}. Then since $[q+1,p-2] \subset \partial_{in}P$, it follows inductively from item (4) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi} that $[q+2,p-1] \not\subset \phi(P)$, hence $\phi(P) \subset [p,q]$.

If $i, i+1 \in [p,q]$ and $i \to i+1 \in Q$, then by inspection $i \notin \partial_{in}P$; item (1) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi} then implies that if $i \in \phi(P)$, we also have $i+1 \in \phi(P)$. If instead $i \leftarrow i+1$, then by inspection $i \in \partial_{in}P$; item (2) in Lemma \ref{lem:phi} then implies that if $i +1 \in \phi(P)$, we also have $i \in \phi(P)$. Putting these facts together we see that $\phi(P)$ is target-closed in $[p,q]$.

Suppose now that $E \in \cE$ is a target-closed subset of $[p,q]$. We define a collection $P \in \cP$ with $\phi(P) = E$ by specifying the path $P_i \in P$ which begins at boundary source $i \in S_{[p,q]}$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $i \in [q+1,p-2]$ then $P_i$ stays on level $i$.
\item If $i \in \{q,k_1,\dotsc,k_m\}$ and $i \notin E$, then $P_i$ stays on level $i$.
\item If $i \in \{q,k_1,\dotsc,k_m\}$ and $i \notin E$, let $j \in E$ be the index such that $[j,i] \subset E$ is the largest interval in $E$ with $k \to k+1$ in $Q$ for all $k \in [j,i-1]$. Then $P_i$ begins on level $i$, follows bridges up to level $j-1$, then returns to end on level $i$.
\item If $i$ is not of the above form, then  $P_i$ stays on level $i$ if $i \notin E$ and moves from level $i$ to level $i-1$ and back if $i \in E$.
\end{enumerate}

\sayHW{Things not addressed yet: why is $P \mapsto \phi(E)$ injective on $\cP$, why is the above prescription for $P$ actually in $\cP$, what about the other tube?}

% Since the total number of sinks and sources in $[p,q]$ is even, it follows that $Q$ has an arrow $q \to q+1$. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Affine Tubes}\sayDR{Clean up this section.}
  Let $Q$ be an acyclic affine quiver of type $A$, in particular $Q$ contains at least one source.  Suppose $Q$ has $p$ clockwise pointing arrows $\{\vec{a}_1,\ldots,\vec{a}_p\}$ labeled counterclockwise around $Q$ and $q$ counterclockwise pointing arrows $\{\cev{a}_1,\ldots,\cev{a}_q\}$ labeled clockwise around $Q$. \sayDR{This seemingly strange choice of labeling will make extensions go in the right directions later and thus keep the arrows in the AR quiver pointing from left to right.  The phrase ``against the flow'' might be appropriate to include somewhere.}  It will be convenient to allow arbitrary integer labeling of the arrows taken modulo $p$ and $q$ respectively.  Thus $Q$ takes the following form:

  For a vertex $i$ in $Q$, write $i_+$ for the next vertex of $Q$ counterclockwise from $i$ and write $i^+$ for the next source or sink of $Q$ counterclockwise from $i$.  Define $i_-$ and $i^-$ similarly by looking clockwise from $i$.  Note that $t(\vec{a}_\ell)_+=s(\vec{a}_\ell)$ and $t(\cev{a}_\ell)_-=s(\cev{a}_\ell)$.  Also note that when $i$ is a source (resp. a sink) in $Q$, both $i^-$ and $i^+$ will be sinks (resp. sources) in $Q$.  

  For vertices $i$ and $j$ in $Q$, write $[i,j]\subset Q_0$ for the subset of vertices contained weakly between $i$ and $j$ when tracing counterclockwise around $Q$ from $i$ to $j$.  Define $(i,j)$, $(i,j]$, and $[i,j)$ similarly.  Let $M_{[i,j]}$ denote the indecomposable representation of $Q$ which contains a one-dimensional vector space at each vertex $k\in[i,j]$ and a nonzero map at each arrow traversed from $i$ to $j$.  In particular, $\{i,j\}\subset\supp\soc\big(M_{[i,j]}\big)\cup\supp\top\big(M_{[i,j]}\big)$ and we take $M_{[i,i]}$ to be the simple representation $S_i$ at vertex $i$.  When enumerating over the elements of $[i,j]$ we will usually write $\sum\limits_{k=i}^j$ instead of the more proper $\sum\limits_{k\in[i,j]}$.

  For $\ell\in\ZZ$ define indecomposable representations $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:=M_{[s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1}),t(\vec{a}_\ell)]}$ and $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:=M_{[t(\cev{a}_\ell),s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})]}$.  Note that when $t(\vec{a}_\ell)$ (resp. $t(\cev{a}_\ell)$) is not a sink in $Q$ the representation $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}$ (resp. $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}$) will be simple and otherwise $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}$ (resp. $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}$) will be a string module with socle $S_{t(\vec{a}_\ell)}$ (resp. $S_{t(\cev{a}_\ell)}$) and top $S_{s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1})}$ (resp. $S_{s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})}$).  From this we see that the collections $\{\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le p\}$ and $\{\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le q\}$ give families of pairwise orthogonal bricks, i.e. there are no nonzero morphisms between non-isomorphic representations and each of these representations has trivial endomorphism ring.

  Denote by $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ (resp. $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$) the full, extension-closed, additive subcategory of $\rep Q$, called the \emph{clockwise} (resp. \emph{counterclockwise}) \emph{tubular subcategory} (tube), generated by $\{\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le p\}$ (resp. $\{\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le q\}$).  Following \cite[Section 3.1]{Rin84} the clockwise and counterclockwise tubes are serial, abelian categories with simple objects given by $\{\vec{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le p\}$ and $\{\cev{M}_{1,\ell}:1\le\ell\le q\}$ respectively.  In each case these ``simple'' objects form the mouth of the corresponding tubular categories.

  For $\ell\in\ZZ$, label the dimension vector of the ``simple'' object $\vec{M}_{1,\ell}$ as
  \begin{equation}
    \vec{\beta}_{1,\ell}=\sum_{i=s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1})}^{t(\vec{a}_\ell)}\alpha_i
  \end{equation}
  and the dimension vector of the ``simple'' object $\cev{M}_{1,\ell}$ as
  \begin{equation}
    \cev{\beta}_{1,\ell}=\sum_{i=t(\cev{a}_\ell)}^{s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})}\alpha_i.
  \end{equation}
  The coindices of these representations can be described as follows:
  \begin{align}
    \vec{\lambda}_{1,\ell}&=\omega_{t(\vec{a}_\ell)}-\omega_{s(\vec{a}_\ell)}\\
    \cev{\lambda}_{1,\ell}&=\omega_{t(\cev{a}_\ell)}-\omega_{s(\cev{a}_\ell)}.
  \end{align}

  Define indecomposable representations $\vec{M}_{k,\ell}$ and $\cev{M}_{k,\ell}$ for $k\ge0$ and $\ell\in\ZZ$ inductively via the short exact sequences
  \[0\longrightarrow\vec{M}_{k-1,\ell}\longrightarrow\vec{M}_{k,\ell}\longrightarrow\vec{M}_{1,k+\ell-1}\longrightarrow0\]
  and
  \[0\longrightarrow\cev{M}_{k-1,\ell}\longrightarrow\cev{M}_{k,\ell}\longrightarrow\cev{M}_{1,k+\ell-1}\longrightarrow0.\]
  It follows that the dimension vectors of these representations are given for $1\le k\le p-1$ by
  \begin{align}
    \vec\beta_{k,\ell}=\sum_{m=1}^k\vec\beta_{1,\ell+m-1}=\sum_{i=s(\vec{a}_{\ell-1})}^{t(\vec{a}_{k+\ell-1})}\alpha_i
  \end{align}
  and for $1\le k\le q-1$ by
  \begin{align}
    \cev\beta_{k,\ell}=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\cev\beta_{1,\ell+m-1}=\sum_{i=t(\cev{a}_{k+\ell-1})}^{s(\cev{a}_{\ell-1})}\alpha_i.
  \end{align}
  Similarly the coindices of these representations can be computed for $1\le k\le p-1$ as
  \begin{align}
    \vec\lambda_{k,\ell}
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\vec\lambda_{1,\ell+m-1}\\
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\omega_{t(\vec{a}_{\ell+m-1})}-\omega_{s(\vec{a}_{\ell+m-1})}
  \end{align}
  and for $1\le k\le q-1$ as
  \begin{align}
    \cev\lambda_{k,\ell}
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\cev\lambda_{1,\ell+m-1}\quad\text{}\\
    &=\sum\limits_{m=1}^k\omega_{t(\cev{a}_{\ell+m-1})}-\omega_{s(\cev{a}_{\ell+m-1})}.
  \end{align}

  \begin{proposition}\mbox{}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The modules listed above provide a complete set of simple objects in the categories $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ and $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$.  Moreover, every object of $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ and $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$ admits a unique Jordan-H\"older series with the corresponding ``simples'' as composition factors.
      \item The indecomposable, rigid regular representations of $Q$ are exactly the representations from $\overrightarrow{\rep}Q$ and $\overleftarrow{\rep}Q$ of length at most $q-1$ and $p-1$ respectively, where length refers to the Jordan-H\"older length in the respective categories.  
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proposition}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Cite Ringel's ``Tame Algebras and Integral Quadratic Forms''?  \cite[Theorem 3.6.5]{Rin84} where the described generators form the base of the tubes.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}
  \begin{remark}\label{rem:rigid regulars}
    Note that none of the rigid regular representations is sincere and all of them take the form $M_{[i,j]}$ for some $i$ and $j$ with $i\ne j_+$.
  \end{remark}

  \begin{corollary}
    A representation $M$ of $Q$ is regular if and only if $\sum\limits_{\ell=1}^r\dim M_{i_\ell}$ is even.
  \end{corollary}

  The next goal is to enumerate the subrepresentations of each rigid $M_{[i,j]}$.  

  The minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ can be understood in terms of the quiver $Q_{[i,j]}$ as well.  This requires a couple of cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $i$ and $j$ are sinks in $Q_{[i,j]}$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s+1}{2}} I_{j_{2t-1}}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a sink in $Q_{[i,j]}$ and $j$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t-1}}\longrightarrow I_{j+1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a sink in $Q_{[i,j]}$ and $j$ is a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t-1}}\longrightarrow \bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a sink in $Q_{[i,j]}$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{i-1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a sink in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-2}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{i-1}\oplus I_{j+1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{j+1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ is a source in $Q_{[i,j]}$ but not a source in $Q$ and $j$ is a source in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow I_{i-1}\oplus\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
    \item $i$ and $j$ are sources in $Q$ then a minimal injective copresentation of $M_{[i,j]}$ is given by
    \[0\longrightarrow M_{[i,j]}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-1}{2}} I_{j_{2t}}\longrightarrow\bigoplus_{t=1}^{\frac{s-3}{2}} I_{j_{2t+1}}\longrightarrow0\]
  \end{itemize}

  Call a vertex $i$ of a connected subquiver $Q'$ of $Q$ an \emph{internal source of $Q'$} if $i$ is a source of $Q$ and $Q'$ contains a sink both clockwise and counterclockwise from $i$.
  \begin{lemma}\mbox{}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item For $1\le k\le p-1$ we have
      \[\vec{\lambda}_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i\in I}\omega_i-\sum_{i\in O}\omega_i\]
      where $I$ denotes the sinks in the support quiver $Q_{k,\ell}$ of $\vec{M}_{k,\ell}$ and $O$ denotes the set of internal sources of $\vec{Q}_{k,\ell}$ together with $s(\vec{a}_{k+\ell-1})$.
      \item For $1\le k\le q-1$ we have
      \[\cev{\lambda}_{k,\ell}=\sum_{i\in I}\omega_i-\sum_{i\in O}\omega_i\]
      where $I$ denotes the sinks in the support quiver $Q_{k,\ell}$ of $\cev{M}_{k,\ell}$ and $O$ denotes the set of internal sources of $\cev{Q}_{k,\ell}$ together with $s(\cev{a}_{k+\ell-1})$.

\section{Appendix: Cluster Algebras --- OLD STUFF TO BE REMOVED}
Let $A$ be any irreducible Cartan matrix of infinite type and let $c=s_1\dots s_n$ be a Coxeter element in the Weyl group of $A$. 
Because of the assumption, any prefix of the infinite word $c^\infty$ is reduced. 
The letters of $c^\infty$ (and thus its prefixes) are naturally labeled by pair of integers $(k,m)$ with $1\leq k\leq n$ and $m\geq 0$ where the element $c^ms_1\dots s_k$ corresponds to the indices $(k,m)$. 
\saySS{We should be able to do this also in finite type replacing prefixes with reduced words.}
Let $\cAb(B_c)$ be the cluster algebra with principal coefficients associated to $c$.
\saySS{We may want to settle the notation that relates $B_c$ to $A$ and $c$ once and for all in some notation section.}

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{preprojective} cluster variables of $\cAb(B_c)$ are the cluster variables obtained by mutating along the word $c^\infty$.
  Namely $x_{k,m}$ is the cluster variable obtained from the initial cluster by mutating the cluster variables $x_{1,0},x_{2,0},\ldots,x_{n,0},x_{1,1}$ through $x_{k,m}$.
  \saySS{This phrasing sucks but I am fighting the blank page at the moment.}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  The preprojective cluster variables of $\cAb(B_c)$ satisfy the exchange relations
  \begin{equation}
    x_{k,m-1}x_{k,m} = \prod_{i<k}x_{i,m}^{-a_{i,k}} \prod_{i>k}x_{i,m-1}^{-a_{i,k}} + \prod_{j\in I}y_j^{[c^{m-1}\beta_k^+:\alpha_j]}
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
This follows immediately from the following Lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{le:positive mutations}
  Let $\tilde B=\left[\begin{array}{c} B\\ M\end{array}\right]$ denote an $m\times n$ ($m\ge n)$ exchange matrix with $b_{ik}\le0$ for $1\le i\le n$ and $m_{ik}\ge0$ for $n+1\le i\le m$.  Writing $\mu_k\tilde B=\left[\begin{array}{c} B'\\ M'\end{array}\right]$ we have $M'=MF_k$ where $F_k=(f_{ij})$ with $f_{ij}=\begin{cases}1 & \text{if $i=j\ne k$;}\\ -1 & \text{if $i=j=k$;}\\ b_{kj} & \text{if $i=k$;}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$
\end{lemma}
Define the $2n\times n$ matrix $\tilde B_{k,m}=\mu_k\mu_{k-1}\cdots\mu_1(\mu_n\cdots\mu_1)^m\left[\begin{array}{c} B_c\\ I_n\end{array}\right]$ for $0\le k\le n-1$ and $m\in\ZZ$.  Write $\gamma^{(k,m)}_j\in\ZZ^n$ for the last $n$ rows of the $j^th$ column of $\tilde B_{k,m}$, where we identify $\ZZ^n$ with the root lattice.  These are the $c$-vectors of $\tilde B_{k,m}$.
\begin{lemma}\mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The principal part of column $k$ in $\tilde B_{k,m}$ is weakly positive while the principal part of column $k+1$ is weakly negative (with the convention that column $0$ refers to the last column of $\tilde B_{k,m}$).
    \item The $c$-vectors of $\tilde B_{k,m}$ are given by 
    \[\gamma^{(k,m)}_j=\begin{cases}c^m s_1\cdots s_k\alpha_j & \text{if $m\ge0$;}\\\alpha_j & \text{if $m=-1$ and $j\le k$;}\\-\alpha_j & \text{if $m=-1$ and $j>k$;}\\-c^{m+1} s_1\cdots s_k\alpha_j & \text{if $m<-1$.}\end{cases}\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The first claim is essentially the statement that the sequence $1,\ldots,n$ (resp. $n,\ldots,1$) is sink (resp. source) adapted for $Q$.

  For the final claim we work by induction on the length of the mutation sequence.  For $k=m=0$ we have $\gamma^{(0,0)}_j=\alpha_j$ is exactly the $j^{th}$ column of the identity matrix.  For the general case we claim that
  \[\gamma^{(k,m)}_j=s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}\big(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j\big).\]

  To see this, recall that the pairing $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is $W$-invariant, in particular we have $(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j,\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k)=(\alpha_j,\alpha_k)$.  Using this we may compute
  \begin{align*}
    s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}\big(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j\big)
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j-\frac{(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k,\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j)}{2(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k,\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k)}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k\\
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j-\frac{(\alpha_k,\alpha_j)}{2(\alpha_k,\alpha_k)}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k\\
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j-a_{kj}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k\\
    &=\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j+b_{kj}\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k.
  \end{align*}
  
  Thus the claim follows from Lemma~\ref{le:positive mutations} \sayDR{Cite [Nakanishi-Zelevinsky, Prop. 1.3] instead}.  To conclude the proof we note that 
  \[s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}=c^m s_1\cdots s_{k-1} s_k s_{k-1}\cdots s_1 c^{-m}\]
  and thus applying the induction hypothesis
  \[\gamma^{(k,m)}_j=s_{\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_k}\big(\gamma^{(k-1,m)}_j\big)=c^m s_1\cdots s_k\alpha_j.\]
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:changeofcoeffs}
Let $B$ and $B'$ be $(n+m)\times n$ exchange matrices and $M$ and invertible $m \times m$ matrix such that the bottom $m \times n$ part of $B$ is equal to $M$ times the bottom $m \times n$ part of $B'$.  Let $x_1,\dotsc,x_n$ and $x'_1,\dotsc,x'_n$ be the mutable initial cluster variables of $\cA(B)$ and $\cA(B')$, respectively, and $y_1,\dotsc,y_m$, $y'_1,\dotsc, y'_m$ their frozen variables.  Then the map $x'_i \mapsto x_i$, $y'_j \mapsto \prod_{i=1}^m y_i^{M_{ij}}$ extends to an isomorphism of upper cluster algebras.
